## Chapter VIII — The Law of Progress

### The State of Nature

**776. Are the state of nature and natural law the same thing?**

No. The state of nature refers to humanity’s earliest, most primitive condition. Civilization cannot exist there. Natural law, however, is something else entirely—it guides and sustains human progress.

The state of nature is like early childhood. It marks the beginning of our intellectual and moral journey, not its destination. Human beings carry within themselves the seed of growth and transformation. Just as no one is meant to remain an infant forever, humanity is not meant to remain in a primitive state. Civilization is a passage forward.

Natural law governs all people at all times. We grow to the extent that we understand it more deeply and live it more faithfully.

**777. Since there are fewer needs in the state of nature, people suffer fewer self-created hardships. Why do some see it as a state of perfect happiness?**

That kind of happiness is the happiness of ignorance—the simple contentment of instinct. It is the happiness of animals. Some people understand no other form. Children, too, often seem happier than adults, but that does not mean childhood is the goal of life.

**778. Can humanity regress back to the state of nature?**

No. Humanity must continue forward and cannot return to infancy. Progress is part of divine intention. To believe otherwise would be to deny the law of progress itself.

### The March of Progress

**779. Do human beings draw the power to progress from within themselves, or is progress merely the result of education?**

They advance naturally from within. Progress does not unfold at the same pace or in the same way for everyone. Social life allows those who are more advanced to help others grow.

**780. Does moral progress always follow intellectual progress?**

Moral progress flows from intellectual progress—but not always immediately.

> *How does intellectual progress lead to moral progress?*

By helping people understand good and evil. Once discernment grows, choice becomes possible. As intelligence develops, free will strengthens—and with it, responsibility.

> *Why then are the most enlightened cultures sometimes the most morally corrupted?*

Because full progress takes time. Like individuals, cultures move step by step. Before moral awareness is sufficiently developed, intelligence may be used in harmful ways. Intelligence and morality are two forces that only reach harmony over time.

**781. Can humanity ever halt progress?**

No—but it can slow it.

> *What should we think of those who try to stop progress or force regression?*

They are driven by pride and illusion. They will be swept away by the very movement they seek to resist.

Progress is woven into human nature. No one has the power to extinguish it. Flawed laws may obstruct it temporarily, but when those laws clash with justice, progress eventually dismantles them. This continues until human laws align with divine justice—which seeks the good of all, not the advantage of the strong over the weak.

**782. Are there not people who, in good faith, resist progress because they mistake its direction?**

They are like a small pebble beneath a great wheel—incapable of stopping its movement.

**783. Does human progress always unfold slowly and gradually?**

Most often, yes. But when a society stagnates too long, God permits a physical or moral upheaval that reshapes it.

Humanity cannot remain in ignorance forever. Moral and social revolutions often take centuries to gestate. They grow quietly beneath the surface, then suddenly emerge—toppling outdated structures that no longer meet humanity’s deeper needs. These moments may look like chaos, but from a wider view, they purify and renew, like storms that cleanse the air.

**784. Given humanity’s great moral failings, doesn’t it seem that people are regressing rather than advancing?**

It may appear so, but look more closely. Humanity is progressing because it understands evil more clearly—and that understanding leads, slowly but surely, to reform. The excess of wrongdoing awakens the need for goodness.

**785. What is the greatest obstacle to progress?**

Pride and selfishness—especially in moral progress. Intellectual progress always continues, but at first it can seem to amplify ambition and greed. Yet even this has a purpose: it drives inquiry and awakening. In time, people come to understand that beyond material wealth lies a far greater and lasting fulfillment.

There are two kinds of progress—intellectual and moral. They support each other but rarely advance in step. Moral progress has already occurred, even if it lags behind intelligence. To deny future moral growth would be to assume humanity has reached perfection—which is clearly not true.

### Relapsed Cultures

**786. History shows cultures that fell back into barbarism after catastrophe. Where is progress in that?**

When a house becomes unsafe, it must be torn down so something stronger can be built. During reconstruction, there is disorder.

Likewise, the spirits who once animated those cultures have moved on. Having progressed, they inhabit more advanced conditions, while less developed spirits take their place—for now. They, too, will advance and move on in time.

**787. Are there peoples who naturally resist progress?**

Yes—but they gradually disappear physically.

> *What becomes of their souls?*

They progress like all others, through many lives. No one is abandoned.

> *Could today’s civilized people once have been cannibals?*

Yes—and many times over.

**788. Do cultures, like individuals, decline and die?**

Cultures rooted only in material power rise and fall. But those aligned with eternal laws—justice, love, charity—endure and become guiding lights for others.

**789. Will progress someday unite all peoples into one nation?**

Not into one nation, but into one moral family. Customs and laws will differ, but charity transcends borders. When divine law undergirds human law, people live peacefully—without exploitation or deceit.

Progress unfolds through individuals who awaken and then lift others with them. Through reincarnation, no effort is lost. Those born into less enlightened times return under better conditions, ensuring justice and equal opportunity for growth.

### Civilization

**790. Is civilization progress or decadence?**

It is incomplete progress. Humanity does not leap from childhood to maturity.

> *Should civilization be condemned?*

No—only its misuse. Civilization itself is part of divine work.

**791. Will civilization one day be purified of its evils?**

Yes—when moral development equals intellectual development. The fruit cannot appear before the flower.

**792. Why doesn’t civilization immediately produce all the good it promises?**

Because humanity is not yet ready—and because new needs awaken new passions. Growth takes time.

**793. How can we recognize a truly complete civilization?**

By its moral character. True civilization is not measured by inventions or comfort, but by the absence of injustice, pride, and selfishness—by lives lived in mutual respect, generosity, and compassion.

### The Progress of Human Legislation

**794. Could society be governed solely by natural law?**

Yes—if people understood and lived it fully. Until then, human laws are necessary.

**795. Why are human laws unstable?**

Because they often arise from power rather than justice. As understanding grows, laws gradually align with natural law.

**796. Are harsh criminal laws necessary?**

Only for societies that have not yet healed their roots. Education—not punishment—is the true reformer.

**797. How will laws be reformed?**

Through time, circumstance, and the influence of morally awakened individuals.

### Spiritism’s Influence on Progress

**798. Will Spiritism become widely accepted?**

Yes. It belongs to human understanding and marks a new era. Resistance will fade with time.

**799. How does Spiritism contribute to progress?**

By dissolving materialism and revealing humanity’s shared destiny. It teaches solidarity beyond race, class, or belief.

**800. Can it overcome human indifference?**

Transformation is gradual. Even the healing of one soul is a profound victory.

**801. Why weren’t these teachings given earlier?**

Because humanity was not ready. Like seeds, truths mature in their season.

**802. Why don’t the Spirits convince everyone through undeniable miracles?**

Because true conviction must arise through reason and inner awakening. Even miracles are often denied. God grants humanity the dignity of choosing truth freely.

Progress is not forced. It is invited.
