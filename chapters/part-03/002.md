## Chapter II — The Law of Worship

### The Purpose of Worship

**649. What does worship entail?**

Worship is the lifting of the heart and mind toward God. Whenever you turn your thoughts lovingly to the Divine, your soul moves a little closer to its Source.

**650. Is worship something we are taught, or is it innate?**

Worship springs from something deep within us. Just as we carry a sense of the Divine, we also carry a longing to reach toward that Presence. Our awareness of our own smallness and fragility naturally leads us to seek the One who can guide and protect us.

**651. Have there ever been peoples without any sense of worship?**

No. There have never been truly atheistic peoples. In every culture, in every age, humans have sensed that there is a reality above and beyond them— a Supreme Being, however dimly understood.

**652. Does worship belong to natural law?**

Yes. It is part of natural law because it grows out of an instinct planted in the human heart. This is why all peoples worship in some way, even though the outward forms may be very different.

### Outward Worship Forms

**653. Does worship require outward expression?**

True worship begins in the heart. You are worshiping whenever you act, speak, or think with the awareness that God is present with you and within you.

- *Are outward forms of worship useful nonetheless?*

Yes, if they are sincere and not just a show. Outward practices—prayer gatherings, rituals, songs— can encourage others and point them toward God. But when someone uses these forms only to appear holy, while their actions contradict their display, they do more harm than good, and their example misleads more than it helps.

**654. Does God prefer one style or form of worship over another?**

God delights in sincere hearts, not in particular styles. Those who quietly strive to do good and avoid evil honor God more than those who cling to elaborate ceremonies yet fail to become more loving than their neighbor.

All are siblings—children of the same God. Whoever walks in the path of divine love and justice is heard, no matter how they outwardly express their devotion.

Those who wear a mask of piety but live with pride, envy, resentment, or harshness toward others, show that their religion is in their mouth and not in their heart. The more clearly a person knows the truth, the more accountable they are for the way they live it.

So don’t ask which ritual or language is most pleasing to God. That would be like asking which language Love prefers to be spoken in. Hymns, prayers, and ceremonies only reach heaven when they pass through the doorway of the heart.

**655. Is it wrong to practice a religion outwardly that we do not truly believe in, just to avoid offending others?**

As in many things, intention matters. If you join in outward practices simply to avoid wounding another’s sincere faith, you do no wrong; in fact, you show respect and charity.

But if you wear religious forms as a disguise to gain status, power, or advantage, your worship becomes empty. God is not pleased with a show of humility meant only to win human approval.

**656. Is group worship better than individual worship?**

There is a unique strength when hearts gather together— a shared intention draws helpful spirits and deepens devotion. But this does not diminish the value of solitary worship. A single person, in the quiet of their own soul, can touch God just as truly and intimately.

### The Contemplative Life

**657. Do those who live only in contemplation, avoiding doing harm and thinking only of God, have merit in God’s sight?**

Not simply for avoiding harm. If they do no good, their life remains closed in on itself. God indeed wants us to remember and love the Divine, but also to fulfill the responsibilities we have been given in this world.

A life spent only in meditation, without service or generosity, may be inwardly focused but offers little to others. God will ask not only what harm we avoided but also what good we chose not to do.

### Prayer

**658. Is prayer pleasing to God?**

Yes—when it rises from the heart. For God, intention matters more than eloquence. A simple, heartfelt cry is more precious than a beautifully written prayer recited without attention or feeling.

Prayer that is sincere, trusting, and humble opens us to God’s presence. But words that are proud, vain, or self-centered carry little weight—unless they mark a true turning, a beginning of repentance and real change.

**659. What is the general character of prayer?**

Prayer is an act of worship and connection. When you pray, you turn your mind toward God, draw near, and open yourself to a living relationship.

Through prayer, we can do three things:
- praise,  
- ask,  
- and give thanks.

**660. Does prayer make people better?**

Yes. Those who pray with trust and sincerity draw strength to resist destructive impulses and habits. God sends good and wise spirits to support such souls. Help is never refused when it is genuinely and humbly sought.

- *Why then do some people who pray often still remain jealous, harsh, or cruel?*

Because what matters is not how much we pray, but how we pray. Some people treat prayer as an activity or a habit, without allowing it to examine their hearts. They multiply words, but do not invite change. Prayer is like a remedy: it is not the medicine that fails, but the way it is taken.

**661. Can we effectively ask God to forgive our sins?**

You may ask, and God always sees the sincerity of your heart. But forgiveness is not just a request—it is a path. Prayer does not hide our actions from God. True forgiveness unfolds as we change our behavior, repair what we can, and walk in a new way. Good deeds, lived from the heart, are the deepest kind of prayer.

**662. Can we pray effectively for others?**

Yes. When you pray for someone, your spirit reaches out in loving intention. Through that prayer, good spirits may be drawn to guide, comfort, and strengthen the one you remember.

Our thoughts and will have a reach far beyond our physical presence. A sincere prayer from the heart can inspire new courage, suggest better thoughts, and soften a troubled soul. Once again, it is the inner sincerity that matters— words alone do nothing.

**663. Can our prayers for ourselves change the nature or course of our trials?**

Some trials must be lived through fully; they are woven into our growth. God may not always remove them, but God never ignores our prayer.

Prayer brings strength, patience, and clarity, and with this inner support, what once seemed unbearable becomes lighter. Often, divine help comes through very ordinary means— a new idea, a conversation, a shift of perspective— so natural that we might not even recognize it as an answer to prayer.

God does not rearrange the entire universe for each individual desire, but continually works for a greater good that we often cannot yet see.

**664. Is it useful to pray for those who have died or for suffering spirits? Can our prayers lessen their pain or shorten their trials?**

Prayer does not change God’s justice, but it deeply affects the heart of the one we pray for.

When a suffering spirit senses it is remembered and loved, it finds comfort and hope. Our prayer can awaken in it a desire to grow, to turn toward light and healing. That desire attracts helping spirits who come to console, teach, and encourage.

In this way, our loving remembrance can support and hasten its progress— but always in cooperation with its own free will.

Jesus himself prayed for those who had gone astray. By doing this, he showed us our responsibility to remember and uphold those most in need.

**665. What should we think of those who reject prayers for the dead because they are not explicitly commanded in the Gospels?**

Christ simply said, *“Love one another.”* Within that commandment lies everything. To love is to use all the means at our disposal to support, comfort, and uplift others— on this side of death and beyond it.

Our prayers do not cancel out the soul’s responsibility, but they are a precious sign of remembrance. The one who suffers feels strengthened by knowing someone cares enough to intercede. This shared love deepens the bond between souls and helps fulfill the divine law of unity toward which all spirits are moving.

**666. May we pray to spirits?**

You may ask for the help of good spirits, for they are servants and messengers of God, working within the order God has established.

Their ability to help depends on their own spiritual growth and always remains under God’s authority. Thus, prayers directed to them are effective only insofar as they harmonize with the will of God.

### Polytheism

**667. If it is not accurate, why has polytheism been so ancient and widespread?**

The clear idea of one God emerged slowly as human understanding developed.

In earlier times, people struggled to conceive of a God who is invisible, immaterial, and yet active in the world. So they attributed God-like status to anything that seemed beyond the ordinary— forces of nature, powerful leaders, or mysterious phenomena they could not explain.

From there it was only a small step to imagining many gods, each responsible for a different aspect of life.

Yet even then, some more enlightened souls sensed that behind all these powers there must be a single, higher Intelligence holding everything together.

**668. Since spirit phenomena have always existed, did they contribute to belief in many gods?**

Yes. People called “gods” anything that seemed greater than human. Spirits—being invisible, powerful, and mysterious— were easily mistaken for deities.

Likewise, individuals who stood out because of their wisdom, brilliance, or unusual abilities were often treated as divine after death.

In ancient times, the word “god” had a broad meaning and did not always refer to a Creator of all things. Many so-called gods were, in reality, spirits— souls like ours at different stages of development.

As understanding has grown, we now see spirits as fellow creatures in God’s universe, not as rivals to God. Their presence and activity are part of the natural order, not a challenge to the unity of the Divine.

Christianity redirected worship from a multitude of powers to the One true God, without denying that spiritual beings continue to exist and act. Spiritism, studied seriously and openly, has helped free these realities from superstition and revealed them as one of the great laws of nature.

### Sacrifice

**669. Why did ancient peoples believe human sacrifice could please God?**

Early humanity had only a very dim understanding of God’s goodness. Their lives were dominated by instinct and fear, and cruelty often mingled with ignorance.

They assumed that a living being must be more valuable to God than any material gift. So they first sacrificed animals, and later human beings, thinking that the worth of the offering had to match the greatness of the One they wished to honor.

Just as people today might buy costly gifts to show love and respect, the ancients imagined that the more precious the victim, the more pleasing the sacrifice. It was a tragic misunderstanding of the Divine heart.

- *Did animal sacrifices come before human sacrifices?*

Yes, they did.

- *So did human sacrifice come from cruelty?*

Not at first—from confusion. People were mistaken about what God desires. Think of the story of Abraham: it illustrates how limited the human view of sacrifice once was. Over time, people twisted the idea even further, using sacrifice as a way to kill enemies and satisfy hatred. But God has never needed or wanted the destruction of God’s own creatures.

**670. Could such sacrifices ever have been pleasing to God if they were made with sincere devotion?**

Never in themselves. But God sees the heart. In their ignorance, some may have believed they were doing a noble thing by offering such lives. God would regard their intention with mercy, while still rejecting the act itself.

As humanity matured, it became clear that such sacrifices were incompatible with a more enlightened understanding of God. Spirits, clothed in matter and guided by free will, gradually awakened to the wrong they were doing— even if some continued, driven by their passions and desires for power.

**671. What should we think of so-called “holy wars,” where people believe they are serving God by killing those of different beliefs? Do these not stem from the same root as human sacrifice?**

Yes, they spring from similar errors. Such wars are stirred up by misguided or malicious spirits. They go directly against God’s will, which is that we love our neighbor as ourselves.

All peoples, whatever their religion or name for God, are reaching toward the same Divine Reality. Why then destroy others because they are at a different stage of understanding?

Violence in the name of religion contradicts the very message of peace it claims to defend. People must be invited into truth by kindness, patience, and example— never by bloodshed.

**672. Is offering the fruits of the earth more pleasing to God than sacrificing animals?**

What matters most is the heart from which the offering flows. Of course, giving what nourishes life is closer to God’s intention than shedding blood.

But above all, God values the prayer of the heart far more than any outward offering. A simple act of sincere devotion outweighs the richest ritual devoid of love.

**673. Wouldn’t offerings be even more pleasing to God if they were used to help the poor? Wouldn’t it be more truly pious to dedicate the first fruits of the earth to those in need rather than to ritual alone?**

Yes. Whenever you transform your offerings into compassion, God is honored.

Helping the poor, comforting the suffering, sharing what you have with those who lack— these are the offerings that delight the Divine heart.

Ceremonies are not necessarily wrong, but much of the wealth spent on them could bring real relief to those who struggle. God loves simplicity and sincerity.

If we worry more about appearance than about love, we have missed the point. Ask yourself: Is God more interested in polished forms or in a heart that quietly chooses mercy?
