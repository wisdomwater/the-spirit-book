## Chapter V — The Law of Preservation

### The Self-Preservation Instinct

**702. Is the instinct of self-preservation a law of nature?**

Yes, absolutely. Every living being carries this instinct within itself, no matter its level of intelligence. In some creatures it acts automatically; in others, it is guided by reflection and choice.

**703. Why did God give all beings the instinct to preserve their lives?**

Because all beings take part in the unfolding of divine purpose. Life itself is the classroom in which growth and refinement occur. The desire to remain alive ensures that this process can continue, even if beings do not consciously understand why they feel this pull toward life.

### The Means of Self-Preservation

**704. Since God has given humans the instinct to live, does God always provide the means for doing so?**

Yes. If people fail to find what they need, it is not because God has withheld it, but because they have misunderstood how to seek it.

God would not give the need for life without also giving the means to sustain it. The earth was created to supply what is necessary for all. Only what is truly needed has lasting value; the superfluous never does.

**705. Why does the earth not always provide enough for human needs?**

Because humans misuse her gifts. They often blame nature for the consequences of their own lack of foresight and restraint.

The earth is a generous mother. She would provide enough for everyone if people learned contentment and moderation. But instead of focusing on necessities, they divert her abundance toward excess and illusion.

Consider nomadic peoples in harsh lands: they almost always find enough to live on because they do not multiply artificial needs. When vast amounts are wasted on frivolous desires, scarcity naturally follows. Nature is not miserly— humanity simply struggles with self-control.

**706. Are the “fruits of the earth” only what grows from the soil?**

No. The soil is the original source of all material resources, even those that appear far removed from it. Everything humans enjoy in this world is ultimately a transformation of what the earth provides.

**707. Why do some lack basic necessities even when abundance exists all around them?**

First, because of human selfishness. Second—and very often—because of human inaction or discouragement.

“Seek and you shall find” does not mean that wishes are fulfilled without effort. It means seeking with perseverance, without indifference or resignation. Obstacles often exist to test patience, courage, and resolve.

Civilization multiplies both needs *and* opportunities. Much progress has been made, yet much remains undone. In a fully mature society, no one would lack necessities except through a failure of personal responsibility.

Nature assigns each person a place, but not at the expense of others. Many suffer because they pursue paths driven by vanity or ambition rather than by their true capacities.

Still, we must acknowledge progress: public hygiene, scientific care, philanthropy, and organized compassion have eased immense suffering. We have not reached perfection— but we have learned what perseverance can accomplish when humanity seeks what truly matters.

**708. Are there cases where lack of necessities results from circumstances beyond human control?**

Yes. Such situations are often severe trials that souls knowingly accept before incarnation.

Their merit lies in trust and endurance when no escape is visible. If death arrives, it should be met without despair, remembering that true freedom begins beyond the body. Despair at the final moment can undo the inner growth achieved through patience.

**709. If people in extreme hunger sacrifice others to survive, have they committed a crime?**

Yes. Preserving one’s own life by taking another’s is a grave violation of natural law and carries serious moral consequence. True merit lies in facing even the hardest trials with courage and selflessness.

**710. On more refined worlds, do beings still need nourishment?**

Yes—but nourishment suited to their nature. Their food would not sustain your dense bodies, just as your food would not suit theirs.

### The Enjoyment of Material Things

**711. Do all humans have the right to use the fruits of the earth?**

Yes. This right flows directly from the need to live. God does not impose a duty without providing the means to fulfill it.

**712. Why did God make material enjoyment attractive?**

To encourage humans to fulfill their roles in creation and to test their ability to remain balanced.

- *Why test them through pleasure?*

So that reason may learn to govern desire and prevent excess.

Pleasure draws humans into action and keeps the world in motion. But it also presents temptation. Through reason, humans are meant to master attraction rather than be mastered by it.

**713. Do enjoyments have natural limits?**

Yes. Nature itself sets those limits. When people exceed them, satiety and suffering follow as natural consequences.

**714. What should we think of those who live for excess?**

They are not fortunate— they are to be pitied. They stand very near to death.

- *Physical or moral death?*

Both.

Those who abandon moderation sink below even animals, who instinctively know when to stop. Excess strengthens the animal nature and weakens the spiritual one. The illnesses and suffering that follow are the natural outcome of violating divine law.

### Necessary and Superfluous Things

**715. How can people know what is truly necessary?**

Those who cultivate wisdom sense it naturally. Others learn through painful experience.

**716. Has nature marked this limit within our bodies?**

Yes. Our physical organization defines real needs. But unchecked desires distort those limits and create artificial ones.

**717. What should be thought of those who hoard abundance while others lack necessities?**

They misunderstand God’s law and will be accountable for the suffering they cause.

What is necessary and what is superfluous changes with civilization. Progress does not require a return to primitive life, but it does require discernment.

Civilization should deepen moral awareness and awaken charity. Those who exploit its benefits while ignoring others’ suffering possess only the appearance of refinement— just as some possess only the appearance of religion.

### Voluntary Privation. Mortifications

**718. Does self-preservation require us to care for our physical needs?**

Yes. Without health and vitality, meaningful labor becomes impossible.

**719. Is seeking personal well-being wrong?**

No. Well-being is natural. Only abuse is forbidden— especially when it harms others or weakens body or soul.

**720. Do voluntary privations undertaken as expiation have merit in God’s sight?**

Doing good for others has far greater merit.

- *Are there any voluntary privations that *are* meritorious?*

Yes. Renouncing unnecessary pleasures strengthens the soul. True merit lies in resisting excess and sharing even what one needs with those who have less. Mere appearance of sacrifice is empty.

**721. Is ascetic mortification practiced across cultures meritorious?**

Ask whom it benefits. If it serves only the self and prevents doing good for others, it is selfish—regardless of its religious disguise.

True mortification is bearing hardship in service to others. That alone aligns with the heart of divine love.

**722. Is abstaining from certain foods a rational religious practice?**

It can be. What harms health should be avoided. Some prohibitions were established to reinforce social order and were framed as divine commands to give them authority.

**723. Is eating animals contrary to natural law?**

Given your current physical nature, no. Your bodies require such nourishment. Self-preservation demands maintaining strength and health so that the law of labor can be fulfilled.

**724. Is abstaining from food meritorious as expiation?**

Yes—when it is done to help others. But deprivation without real sacrifice or benefit is meaningless.

**725. What should we think of bodily mutilations inflicted on humans or animals?**

Ask one question: *Is it useful?* What is useless cannot please God. What causes harm never does.

God responds to what lifts the soul upward, not to acts that degrade the body. Growth comes through living divine law— not through violent rejection of the body.

**726. Can we grow spiritually through sufferings we intentionally create?**

Only natural sufferings foster growth, because they arise within God’s order. Self-inflicted suffering without benefit to others serves no purpose.

If people truly wish to progress, let them serve, comfort, and uplift others. Suffering endured for love has meaning. Suffering chosen for ego does not.

**727. Should we avoid foreseeable suffering, or accept it as spiritual discipline?**

Self-preservation exists to protect life and health. Do not punish the body— discipline the spirit.

Mortify pride. Dismantle selfishness— that serpent consuming the heart. This inner work advances the soul far more than physical austerities that no longer belong to our time.
