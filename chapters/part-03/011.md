## Chapter XI — The Law of Justice, Love and Charity

### Justice and Natural Rights

**873. Is the sense of justice something natural in us, or is it learned?**

It is natural. You can feel it in how quickly you recoil at the thought of unfairness. Moral growth refines this sense, but it does not create it—God has placed it in the human heart. That is why you sometimes find clearer, truer instincts of justice in simple, uneducated people than in those who are highly learned.

**874. If justice is a law of nature, why do people understand it so differently—so that what seems just to one seems unjust to another?**

Because our passions often mix themselves into our sense of justice and distort it. This happens with many natural sentiments: what is pure in essence becomes warped in practice, and we start seeing things through a crooked lens.

**875. How may justice be defined?**

Justice is respecting the rights of others.

* *What determines these rights?*

Two things: human law and natural law. Human societies establish laws according to their customs and maturity, so human “rights” evolve over time. What was once considered just can later be recognized as cruel or barbaric.

Human law regulates certain social relationships. But much of what we do—especially in private life—belongs to the quiet courtroom of conscience, where no external judge can reach.

**876. Outside what human law defines, what is the foundation of justice in natural law?**

Christ gave it plainly: *Do to others what you would have them do to you.* God has placed this rule of true justice inside the heart through a simple desire: that our own rights be respected.

When you’re unsure what you owe another person, ask yourself: *If I were in their place, what would I want done for me?* God could not give you a safer guide than your own conscience.

True justice is not “I want for myself what I want for others.” It is “I want for others what I would want for myself.” That subtle difference matters. Because we do not naturally wish harm upon ourselves, using our own rightful desire as a measure helps ensure we choose what is good for our neighbor.

**877. Does life in society place special obligations on us?**

Yes—and the first is this: respect the rights of others. Those who do so are always just.

In a world where many ignore justice, people retaliate, and society becomes turbulent and confused. Social life gives us rights, but it also lays on us mutual duties.

**878. Since people can be mistaken about their own rights, what helps us know the proper limits?**

The limit is found here: recognize for your neighbor the same rights you claim for yourself in the same situation—and expect the same in return.

* *But if everyone claimed the same rights as their neighbor, wouldn’t subordination collapse and lead to anarchy?*

Natural rights are equal for everyone—from the least to the greatest. God did not make some from “purer clay.” Yet people still sense strength and weakness, wisdom and immaturity, and they naturally offer respect to those who truly deserve it through virtue and insight.

So authority need not disappear. It becomes healthy when it is aligned with wisdom. Subordination is never threatened when leadership is worthy of trust.

**879. What is the character of those who practice justice in its full purity?**

They would be truly just—and they would resemble Jesus—because they would practice love and charity as well. Without love and charity, justice remains incomplete.

### The Right of Ownership. Theft

**880. What is the first natural right of human beings?**

The right to live. No one has the right to attack another’s life or endanger their bodily existence.

**881. Does the right to live include the right to secure what is needed for life and to provide for old age?**

Yes—but with a spirit of shared responsibility. Like bees, people should provide through honest labor and mutual support, not by hoarding as isolated, self-serving individuals. Even animals show forms of foresight without greed.

**882. Do people have the right to defend what they have earned through their labor?**

Yes. God says, “Do not steal,” and Jesus taught respect for lawful order. Property earned honestly through labor is legitimate, and defending it is part of a natural right as sacred as work and life itself.

**883. Is the desire to possess natural?**

Yes. But when possession becomes “only for me”—for personal satisfaction alone—it turns into selfishness.

* *Isn’t it still legitimate to want enough so we aren’t a burden to others?*

Yes. But some accumulate endlessly without serving anyone—driven by appetite rather than need. God does not judge only the legality of wealth, but the spirit in which it is sought.

When someone gains through honest work with the intention of helping others, they are practicing love and charity—and their labor is blessed.

**884. What is the mark of legitimate ownership?**

There is only one: what is acquired without harming others. (See no. 808)

The law of love and justice forbids any means of acquisition that violates the principle, “Do not do to others what you would not want done to you.”

**885. Is the right of ownership unlimited?**

What is legitimately acquired is truly yours. But human law is imperfect and often protects conventional “rights” that natural justice does not approve. This is why laws evolve. What one century calls lawful, another calls barbaric. (See no. 795)

### Charity and Love for Our Neighbor

**886. What is the true meaning of charity as Jesus taught it?**

Benevolence toward everyone; patience with others’ imperfections; and forgiveness for offenses.

Love and charity fulfill what justice begins. To love our neighbor is to do for them the good we would want for ourselves. This is why Jesus said, “Love one another as brothers.”

And charity is not merely giving money. It shapes all our relationships—whether we stand above, beside, or below someone in social standing. It calls us to indulgence because we all need mercy. It forbids humiliating those who are already burdened.

So often, we treat the wealthy with excess attention, while the poor feel like an inconvenience. Yet the more vulnerable a person is, the more carefully we should avoid deepening their shame. True charity lifts dignity. It shortens the distance between people rather than enlarging it.

**887. Jesus said, “Love even your enemies.” Isn’t that against nature? Doesn’t enmity arise from spiritual antipathy?**

Jesus did not demand sentimental affection for those who harm us. Loving enemies means forgiving them and returning good for evil. This is how we rise above them. When we seek vengeance, we sink beneath them.

**888. What should we think of alms-giving?**

When people are forced to beg, they are degraded—morally and materially—by a life that pushes them toward the level of brute survival. A society guided by God’s law and justice would care for the vulnerable without humiliating them. It would ensure the basic life of those who cannot work, without leaving them to chance or passing generosity.

* *Do you condemn giving alms?*

No. What is often blameworthy is not the gift, but the manner of giving.

Those who understand charity as Jesus taught it do not wait to be asked. They seek out the suffering—quietly, respectfully. True charity is gentle. It is felt in the act and in the spirit of the act. A kindness offered with warmth has double value; a kindness offered with pride may be accepted out of need, but it rarely heals the heart.

And remember: ostentation erases merit. Jesus said not to publicize your giving—so that charity is not stained with vanity.

Also, the neediest are not always the ones who ask. Many endure silently because shame restrains them. The truly humane know how to help without making a show of it.

“Love one another”—this is the whole law. Love governs living beings as attraction governs matter. And never forget: every spirit stands between one more advanced—guiding and refining them—and one less advanced—toward whom they owe patience, help, and mercy.

So be charitable not only with coins tossed carelessly, but with attentiveness to hidden poverty. Be patient with faults. Teach rather than despise. Be gentle and benevolent toward those still learning how to be human. In doing so, you obey the law of God.

— *Saint Vincent de Paul*

**889. Aren’t some reduced to begging through their own fault?**

Yes. But if moral education had formed them in God’s law, many would not have fallen into the excesses that ruined them. This is where the healing of the world most deeply begins: in formation of character and conscience. (See no. 707)

### Maternal and Filial Love

**890. Is maternal love a virtue, or is it simply an instinct shared with animals?**

It is both. Nature gives mothers love for their children to preserve life. In animals, this love is mostly limited to physical care and often fades once the young can survive alone.

In humans, maternal love can endure for a lifetime. It can become devotion and self-giving—true virtues. It can even outlast death, accompanying the child from beyond the grave. This love carries something more than instinct. (See nos. 205–385)

**891. If maternal love is natural, why do some mothers hate their children—sometimes from birth?**

Sometimes it is a trial chosen by the child’s spirit, or an expiation for past wrongdoing. In such cases, the mother may be a less-evolved spirit whose inner state creates hardship for the child’s trial.

But violations of nature’s law do not go unanswered. The child’s spirit will be rewarded for the obstacles it endures and overcomes.

**892. When parents have children who cause them great grief, are they excused for feeling less tenderness?**

No. Parenting is a trust given to them, and their mission is to do everything they can to lead their children toward the good. (See nos. 582–583)

And often the grief parents experience is the harvest of earlier permissiveness: unhealthy habits allowed from the cradle. In that sense, they reap what they have sown.
