## Chapter III — The Law of Labor

### The Necessity of Labor

**674. Is the necessity of labor a law of nature?**

Yes. Labor is part of the natural order—an essential rhythm of embodied life. And as societies become more complex, our needs and comforts tend to multiply, which often means we feel compelled to work more to sustain them.

**675. Should we understand “labor” as only material work?**

No. The spirit labors as surely as the body does. Any occupation that is truly useful—whether outward or inward—counts as labor.

**676. Why has labor been imposed on humankind?**

Because of our embodied condition. Labor is both a kind of purification and a means of growth. Without the discipline of effort, the human mind would remain unformed, like a child that never learns to walk.

Through labor we learn to provide for our needs, protect what matters, and develop intelligence and skill. God gives different gifts to different people— more strength here, more insight there— so that no one is without a way to participate. But in some form, labor remains a shared calling.

**677. Why does nature provide for the needs of animals?**

Because animals also labor—though in a more limited way. Their work and intelligence are shaped mainly around survival. So their labor does not lead to moral or intellectual progress as it does in humans.

Yet even so, animals cooperate—often without knowing it— in the larger harmony of creation. Their work plays a real part in nature’s unfolding, even when we cannot immediately see how.

**678. On more advanced worlds, are humans subject to the same necessity of labor?**

The kind of labor changes according to the kind of need. Where material needs are fewer, labor becomes less material too.

But do not imagine that advanced beings become idle. Idleness would feel like a burden— a kind of inner imprisonment—rather than a gift.

**679. Are those with enough wealth to ensure their comfort exempt from the law of labor?**

They may be exempt from physical labor, but not from the deeper obligation to be useful.

To contribute according to one’s means, to develop one’s own intelligence, and to help cultivate the intelligence and well-being of others— this is also labor.

In fact, when someone has been given greater freedom from necessity, their responsibility to do good becomes even greater. Their “extra time” is not merely leisure; it is a portion entrusted to them in advance— so they can serve more widely.

**680. Aren’t there some who are incapable of useful work, whose lives serve no purpose?**

God is just. Only those who *choose* a useless life— living intentionally off the labor of others— are held accountable in this way.

Everyone can be useful according to their capacity. The measure is not brilliance or productivity, but willingness.

**681. Does the law of nature require children to work for their parents?**

Yes—just as parents are obliged to work for their children. This is why God has placed parental love and filial love so naturally in the human heart: so that families will support one another through mutual care.

It is a simple, sacred reciprocity— one that modern society too often forgets.

### The Limit of Labor. Rest

**682. Since rest is needed after labor, is rest also a law of nature?**

Yes. Rest restores the body, and it also creates space for the mind and spirit to rise above the pressure of material life.

Rest is not laziness; it is renewal.

**683. What is the limit of labor?**

The limit is your strength. And in this, God grants each person freedom to discern and honor their own measure.

**684. What should we think of those who abuse authority by imposing excessive work on others?**

This is a grave wrongdoing. Those who command are responsible before God for the burdens they place on those beneath them. To demand excessive labor is to violate divine law.

**685. Do humans have the right to retire in old age?**

Yes. No one is required to labor beyond their capacity.

- *But what resources do elderly people have if they must earn a living but no longer can?*

The strong are meant to support the weak. If family cannot, society must. This is the law of charity.

It is not enough to tell people “you must work.” People must also be able to *find* work. When employment disappears on a large scale, it becomes a kind of famine—an economic calamity.

Many search for solutions in balancing production and consumption, yet even if such balance could be achieved, there will still be cycles—seasons when hardship comes.

So there is another foundation that must not be neglected: education—not merely intellectual training, but the moral formation of character.

Not moral education made of words alone, but the shaping of habits: forethought, steadiness, restraint, integrity. Education is, in many ways, the sum of the habits we acquire.

When countless people are swept into adult life without inner discipline, without guiding principles, left only to impulse, is it any wonder societies suffer?

Disorder and lack of foresight are wounds that only sound education can heal. Here is the beginning of real well-being— a truer security for all.
