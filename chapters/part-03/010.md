## Chapter X — The Law of Freedom

### Natural Freedom

**825. Are there situations in the world where people can truly believe they possess absolute freedom?**

No. Even the least and the greatest among you depend on one another. Relationship itself places limits on absolute freedom.

**826. In what condition could humans enjoy absolute freedom?**

Only in complete solitude—like a hermit in the desert. The moment two people come together, mutual rights arise, and absolute freedom no longer exists.

**827. Does respecting the rights of others diminish our own natural rights?**

Not at all. Those rights are given by nature itself, and honoring others’ rights does not cancel our own.

**828. How can we reconcile the liberal ideals some people proclaim with the despotism they practice at home or over subordinates?**

In such cases, understanding exists only in the intellect, not in the heart. Pride and selfishness cancel out what they know to be right. They turn principles into performance—values spoken but not lived.

* *Will the principles they profess be taken into account in the next life?*

Yes—and the more clearly someone understood those principles, the less excusable they will be for failing to live by them. Simple, sincere souls often advance further than those who appear enlightened but do not embody what they claim to believe.

### Slavery

**829. Are there human beings who are meant by nature to be the property of others?**

No. Any subjection of one human being to another violates the law of God. Slavery is an abuse of power and will fade as humanity progresses, like all abuses.

Any law that legitimizes slavery contradicts nature itself. It reduces people to the level of objects, degrading them physically and morally.

**830. If slavery is embedded in a culture’s customs, are those who practice it still blameworthy?**

Evil remains evil, no matter how normalized it becomes. Cultural habit does not transform injustice into goodness. However, responsibility is measured according to one’s capacity to understand. In earlier times, many practiced slavery in ignorance. But once reason awakened—especially through the light of Christian teaching—and people recognized the enslaved as equals before God, ignorance ceased to be an excuse.

**831. Doesn’t inequality of aptitude justify the subjection of less developed peoples by more intelligent ones?**

No. Differences in aptitude exist to foster development—not domination. Humanity has long erred by treating certain peoples as beasts of burden and claiming superiority of blood. This is blindness. It is not blood that is more or less pure, but the spirit. (See nos. 361–803)

**832. What of those who treat enslaved people “humanely” and believe freedom would harm them?**

They understand their own interests well. They show the same care for animals they wish to profit from. While less cruel than others, they still treat human beings as property and deny them the right to belong to themselves.

### Freedom of Thought

**833. Is there anything within human beings that escapes all constraint?**

Yes—thought. Thought is absolutely free. It may be suppressed in expression, but it cannot be destroyed.

**834. Are people responsible for their thoughts?**

They are responsible before God alone. God alone sees the inner life and judges with perfect justice.

### Freedom of Conscience

**835. Is freedom of conscience a consequence of freedom of thought?**

Yes. Conscience is simply inward thought—belonging entirely to the individual.

**836. Do humans have the right to limit freedom of conscience?**

No more than they have the right to limit freedom of thought. Humans may regulate social relations through law, but only God governs the relationship between conscience and the divine.

**837. What results from suppressing freedom of conscience?**

It forces people into hypocrisy—outward compliance without inner conviction. Freedom of conscience is a defining mark of true civilization.

**838. Is every belief respectable, even when clearly mistaken?**

Every belief is respectable if it is sincere and leads to goodness. Beliefs that generate harm are the ones that deserve reproach.

**839. Are we blameworthy if we scandalize others by imposing our beliefs?**

Yes. That shows a lack of charity and violates freedom of thought.

**840. Does restricting harmful religious practices violate freedom of conscience?**

No. Actions may be restrained when they cause harm. Belief itself remains free.

**841. Should harmful doctrines be tolerated out of respect for conscience, or may we try to correct them?**

You should seek to guide others—but only through gentleness and persuasion, never force. Violence and coercion contradict truth. If anything is to be “imposed,” let it be goodness and fraternity.

**842. How can we recognize which doctrine truly reflects truth?**

By its fruits. The truest doctrine produces the fewest hypocrites and the greatest number of morally transformed lives—lives marked by love, charity, and unity. Teachings that sow division cannot be of God.

### Free Will

**843. Do humans act with free will?**

Yes. Without free will, humans would be machines.

**844. Is free will present from birth?**

It develops gradually. In early life it is limited, expanding as intelligence and awareness grow.

**845. Do instinctive tendencies undermine free will?**

No. Such tendencies arise from the spirit’s past experiences. They may incline a person toward wrongdoing, but they never compel it. Where there is will, there is always a path forward. (See no. 361)

**846. Does the physical body compromise free will?**

Matter influences expression, but it does not create moral faculties. Responsibility remains with the spirit. Suppressing thought to indulge material impulses increases culpability, not excuses it.

**847. Does mental impairment remove free will?**

In such cases, freedom is diminished. This may be a consequence of past misuse of faculties. The spirit remains aware and suffers from the limitation.

**848. Does drunkenness excuse wrongdoing?**

No. Drunkenness is a chosen surrender of reason—adding one wrong to another.

**849. In primitive humanity, which dominates—instinct or free will?**

Instinct dominates early, as in childhood. As intelligence grows, responsibility increases.

**850. Does social position restrict free will?**

Circumstances may constrain, but effort remains possible. God weighs the sincerity of your struggle.

### Fatalism

**851. Are life events predetermined, leaving no room for free will?**

Fatalism applies only to the trials chosen before incarnation—not to moral decisions. Individuals always retain the freedom to choose good or evil.

**852. Are those who seem pursued by misfortune victims of fate?**

Often they are undergoing trials they themselves chose. Hardship becomes more bearable when conscience is clear.

**853. Is death governed by fatalism?**

Yes—only the moment of death is fixed.

**854. Are precautions against danger therefore useless?**

No. Precautions are often inspired precisely to prevent death.

**855. Why does Providence allow dangers that do not end in death?**

They serve as warnings—reminders of fragility and invitations to self-correction.

**856. Does the spirit know how it will die?**

It knows probabilities, not certainties—and still retains freedom.

**857. Why do some face danger fearlessly, believing their time has not yet come?**

Such intuition may arise from spiritual guidance or inner awareness of a chosen mission.

**858. Why do those who foresee death fear it less?**

Because they think as spirits, not as bodies. They recognize death as release.

**859. Are all life events subject to fatalism?**

No. Only entrance into life and departure from it are fixed.

**860. Can humans alter events through their choices?**

Yes—especially by choosing goodness.

**861. Do murderers know beforehand they will commit murder?**

No. Moral acts are never predetermined.

**862. Are those plagued by failure victims of fate?**

Often they chose lives of challenge—or followed paths misaligned with their gifts.

**863. Do social pressures undermine free will?**

Only if one submits to them out of vanity.

**864. Why does success seem to favor some people?**

Sometimes it is skill. Sometimes it is a test that leads to later downfall.

**865. Why does luck favor some in games of chance?**

It may be a temptation—material gain does not guarantee spiritual gain.

**866. Is material fatalism the result of free will?**

Yes. Trials are chosen. Growth depends on how they are borne.

**867. Where does the idea of being “born under a lucky star” come from?**

From superstition mistaken for truth.

### Knowledge of the Future

**868. Can the future be revealed?**

Rarely—and only when it serves a higher purpose.

**869. Why is the future hidden?**

To preserve freedom and initiative.

**870. Why is it sometimes revealed?**

To encourage growth or test character.

**871. Why test people if God already knows the outcome?**

Because justice requires lived choice, not foregone conclusion.

### A Theoretical Summary on the Driving Force Behind Human Actions

**872. Human beings are not driven into evil by fate.**
They choose their trials freely and retain full moral freedom within them. Education is meant to help heal harmful tendencies. Without free will, there would be no merit or responsibility.

Fatalism applies only to the broad framework of life—not to moral choice. Death alone is unavoidable. Everything else unfolds through freedom, influence, and growth.

Humans are not machines. They can resist temptation, call on divine help, and grow stronger through effort. Earth reflects much moral struggle because it is still an early world—but it is also a school.

Life is a trial meant to purify, not condemn. Progress is always possible. And freedom—the ability to choose love over fear—is the sacred gift that makes transformation real.
