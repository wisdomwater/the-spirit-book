## Chapter VII — The Law of Society

### The Need for Societal Life

**766. Is societal life natural?**

Yes—without question. Humanity was created to live in relationship. If we were meant to live alone, there would have been no reason for us to be given speech, emotional sensitivity, or the many faculties that only find meaning through connection with others.

**767. Is absolute isolation contrary to the law of nature?**

Yes. Human beings instinctively seek one another. More than that, no one advances alone. Progress—both personal and collective—depends on mutual support, shared effort, and cooperation.

**768. In seeking societal life, do people follow only personal inclination, or is there a deeper, providential purpose?**

There is a deeper purpose. Growth is essential to human destiny, and growth cannot occur in isolation. No individual possesses every ability or insight. We need one another to awaken what lies dormant within us. When people withdraw completely from society, they lose their refinement and vitality—they harden, and something essential in them begins to fade.

Society exists because each person carries only a portion of what is needed for fullness of life. Through relationship, we complete one another. This mutual dependence is not a flaw—it is by design. We were created to live together, not apart.

### The Life of Isolation. The Vow of Silence

**769. If societal life is natural, why is a taste for absolute isolation considered blameworthy when it also seems natural to some people?**

Because the satisfaction found in total isolation is rooted in selfishness. There are people who find pleasure in excess or intoxication as well—yet that does not make such pleasures healthy or admirable. A life that cuts itself off from others, rendering itself useless to all, cannot be pleasing to God.

**770. What should we think of those who live in complete seclusion to avoid the harmful influences of the world?**

They are doubly selfish.

* *But what if such seclusion is embraced as a form of expiation, through severe discipline and self-denial? Isn’t that worthy?*

Choosing good rather than merely avoiding evil is the truer path. Withdrawal may prevent one kind of wrongdoing, but it often leads to another: neglecting love, service, and compassion. The law of charity cannot be fulfilled in isolation.

**771. How should we view those who withdraw from worldly life in order to devote themselves to helping the suffering?**

These individuals grow spiritually by placing others before themselves. They carry a double merit: they rise above attachment to material pleasures, and they actively do good by honoring the law of labor.

* *And what about those who seek solitude to find the quiet needed for certain kinds of work?*

This is not selfish withdrawal. They are not cutting themselves off from humanity, because their work ultimately serves others. Their solitude is a form of contribution, not abandonment.

**772. What should we think of the vow of silence practiced by certain religious traditions since ancient times?**

You might first ask: is speech natural? And if so, why was it given? God condemns the misuse of human faculties, not their rightful use. Silence can indeed be beneficial at times—it can calm the mind, free the spirit, and open deeper interior awareness. In quiet, the soul can become more receptive.

But a vow of absolute silence is misguided. Those who adopt it often do so with sincere intentions, believing they are pursuing virtue. Yet they misunderstand the deeper laws of life. Total silence, like total isolation, deprives a person of the relationships through which goodness is expressed and progress is made.

### Family Ties

**773. Why is it that among animals, parents and offspring no longer recognize one another once the young no longer need care?**

Because animals live primarily a physical life, not a moral one. A mother’s tenderness toward her young arises from the instinct to preserve life. Once the offspring can survive on their own, her task is complete. Nature then redirects her attention to new life that requires care.

Human family bonds, by contrast, extend beyond instinct. They carry moral, emotional, and spiritual dimensions—inviting love, responsibility, and growth far beyond mere survival.
