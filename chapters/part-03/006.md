## Chapter VI — The Law of Destruction

### Necessary Destruction and Abusive Destruction

**728. Is destruction a law of nature?**

Yes—within the larger rhythm of life. In the world of forms, things must pass away so that they can be renewed. What you call “destruction” is often simply transformation— a change that makes room for regeneration and improvement.

- *Has the instinct of destruction been given to living beings for providential purposes?*

Yes. Creation itself participates in God’s designs. Living beings often survive by consuming other living beings, which serves two purposes: it keeps reproduction from becoming wildly imbalanced, and it allows the material “envelope” of bodies to be reused in nature.

But it is important to see what is truly being destroyed: only the outer covering. The body is not the essence of the thinking being—only its garment. What is essential is the indestructible intelligent principle, which grows through the many changes it passes through.

**729. If destruction is necessary for renewal, why does nature also give beings strong instincts for preservation?**

Because destruction should not come too soon. To end a life prematurely can hinder the soul’s development. So God plants in each being the need to live and to reproduce, so that each can fulfill its season and purpose.

**730. If death opens us to a better life and releases us from many earthly sorrows, why do humans instinctively fear it?**

Because you are meant to complete your task here. The instinct of self-preservation keeps you steady in your trials. Without it, many would surrender to discouragement.

That inner voice that warns you away from danger is also saying, quietly, *“You still have time. There is still good you can do.”* When danger threatens, it becomes a reminder: use well the days you’ve been given.

And yet, humans often thank “luck” for survival instead of recognizing the Giver of life.

**731. Why has nature placed the agents of destruction right alongside the means of preservation?**

Because creation is held in balance— remedy beside illness, counterweight beside force. Equilibrium is part of divine wisdom.

**732. Is the need for destruction the same on all worlds?**

No. It is proportional to how material a world is. As existence becomes more refined—physically and morally— the need for destruction diminishes and can even disappear.

**733. Will the need for destruction always exist for humanity on earth?**

No. As the spirit rises above matter, the urge toward destruction weakens. This is why, as moral and intellectual development grows, a deeper horror of needless destruction often follows.

**734. Do humans, as they are now, have an unlimited right to destroy animals?**

No. The right is limited to real need—food and safety. Abuse has never been a right.

**735. What about destruction beyond need—like hunting purely for pleasure?**

That is the animal nature overpowering the spiritual nature. Any destruction beyond true necessity violates divine law. Animals destroy only to meet their needs; humans, with free will, sometimes destroy without need—and must answer for the misuse of freedom, because in those moments they choose lower impulses.

**736. Do cultures that are extremely scrupulous about not harming animals have special merit?**

A tender conscience is praiseworthy. But when scrupulousness becomes exaggerated and distorted, it can lose its value—especially if it is driven by superstition or fear rather than genuine compassion.

### Destructive Calamities

**737. Why does God allow destructive calamities?**

To hasten progress. Destruction can serve moral regeneration: souls return, learn, and deepen through new experiences.

You must look at the end to understand the outcome. From within a single lifetime, calamities feel like senseless tragedy. But from the wider view, they can accelerate change— bringing a better order in years that might otherwise take centuries.

**738. Couldn’t God improve humanity without calamities?**

Yes—and this is what God seeks every day. Each person is given conscience and reason, the knowledge of good and evil, and the daily opportunity to grow.

But when humans refuse these quieter invitations, calamity sometimes breaks through pride and forces a recognition of human frailty.

- *But good people suffer in calamities too. Is that just?*

You are judging from the body’s point of view. After death, the perspective changes.

A century on earth is a blink compared to eternity. A few days or months of suffering may be a lesson that shapes the soul for ages to come.

Spirits are the enduring reality; bodies are temporary garments. In large calamities, the loss of bodies can be compared to a battle in which uniforms are destroyed— the true concern is for the persons, not the clothing.

- *But aren’t the victims still victims?*

If you could feel the full scale of life, you would hold death less tightly. In the life beyond, those who endured with trust will find ample compensation.

Whether one dies through calamity or ordinary causes, no one escapes when their hour has come. The difference is only that calamities gather many departures at once.

From a broader view, these storms pass across human destiny like weather across a landscape—terrifying up close, yet brief in the span of ages.

**739. Are calamities useful physically, despite the suffering they cause?**

Sometimes. They can alter the conditions of a region and open new possibilities— though the full benefit is often felt more by future generations than by those who lived through the disruption.

**740. Can calamities serve as moral trials as well?**

Yes. They invite humans to use intelligence, patience, and trust— and they can awaken self-denial, detachment, and neighbor-love, if selfishness does not harden the heart.

**741. Can we avert the calamities that afflict us?**

In part, yes. Many disasters are intensified—or even caused— by human carelessness and shortsightedness.

As knowledge grows, people can prevent certain harms by studying causes and acting wisely.

But some sufferings belong to the broader designs of Providence. Each person receives their portion, and these must be met with courage and surrender. Even then, human negligence often worsens what might have been lighter.

Science, art, agriculture, hygiene, and wise planning already show how much can be mitigated. Imagine what humanity could achieve if intelligence were joined consistently to true charity for one another.

### War

**742. What leads humanity to war?**

The animal nature dominating the spiritual— and the thirst to satisfy passions.

In barbaric stages, “might makes right,” and war becomes normal.

As humans evolve, war becomes less frequent because its causes are more clearly seen and resisted. And when conflict does arise, a more mature humanity will at least restrain cruelty and preserve what is humane.

**743. Will war someday disappear from earth?**

Yes—when justice is understood and lived. Then nations will relate as siblings.

**744. What has Providence aimed at in permitting war?**

Freedom and progress.

- *But why does war so often lead to subjugation rather than freedom?*

Because temporary subjugation can, in some cases, accelerate development— pushing cultures forward more rapidly than they would otherwise move.

**745. What about those who stir up war for personal gain?**

They carry heavy guilt. They will require many lives to repair what they have set in motion, because they must answer for every death caused to feed ambition.

### Murder

**746. Is murder a crime in God’s sight?**

Yes—a grave crime. To take a life is to cut short a time of expiation or mission, and this is serious harm.

**747. Is the culpability the same in every case of murder?**

No. God judges the intention, not only the act.

**748. Is murder excused in legitimate self-defense?**

Only true necessity can excuse it. If you can preserve your life without killing the aggressor, you must choose that path.

**749. Are those who kill in war culpable?**

Not if they act under coercion of force. But they remain responsible for cruelty. And any humaneness they show is also counted.

**750. Which is more culpable: parricide or infanticide?**

Both are equally culpable. Crime is crime.

**751. Why is infanticide sometimes condoned even in intellectually advanced societies?**

Because intelligence does not guarantee morality. Some spirits develop cleverness without developing conscience. A brilliant mind may still be deeply immature in love.

### Cruelty

**752. Is cruelty connected to the instinct of destruction?**

Yes—cruelty is the worst distortion of that instinct. Destruction may sometimes be necessary; cruelty never is. Cruelty is always the fruit of a disordered nature.

**753. Why is cruelty common among primitive peoples?**

Because matter dominates spirit. When people live only for bodily needs, self-preservation becomes their only concern, and compassion remains undeveloped.

Also, less mature spirits tend to influence less mature societies, strengthening harshness until more advanced peoples weaken or dissolve that influence.

**754. Does cruelty come from an absence of moral sense?**

Not an absence—an undeveloped state. The moral sense exists in seed form in all humans. In the primitive person it is like the faint fragrance in a closed bud: real, but not yet opened.

All faculties begin as latent potentials. When material impulses are overstimulated, the moral sense is muffled. As the moral nature grows, the purely animal tendencies gradually soften.

**755. Why do even advanced civilizations still contain cruel individuals?**

For the same reason that a tree heavy with good fruit may still bear a few rotten ones.

Some souls wear the appearance of civility while remaining inwardly primitive— wolves in sheep’s clothing.

Very backward spirits may incarnate among advanced peoples to attempt growth. But if the trial overwhelms them, their old nature reasserts itself.

**756. Will society someday be purified of evildoers?**

Humanity is evolving. Those dominated by destructive instincts will gradually fall out of place among more moral people— like bad grain separated from good.

But they will return in new lives, and with time and experience they will learn more clearly what is good and what is harmful.

As with plants and animals shaped through generations, perfection comes slowly. So it is with the soul across many existences.

### Dueling

**757. Can dueling be considered lawful self-defense?**

No. It is murder— and a foolish custom rooted in barbarism.

A truly moral civilization will see dueling as absurd as ancient combats once called “the judgment of God.”

**758. Is it murder if someone enters a duel knowing they are likely to be killed?**

It is suicide.

- *And when the odds are equal?*

It is both murder and suicide.

In all cases, the dueler is culpable: for deliberately threatening another’s life, and for risking their own without necessity or benefit.

**759. What is the value of the so-called “point of honor”?**

It is mostly pride and vanity— two deep wounds in the human soul.

- *But what if honor truly is at stake, and refusing seems cowardly?*

Customs vary by era and culture. Yet as humans mature, they will see that true honor is above passion. A wrong is not redeemed by killing or dying.

True nobility is found in admitting fault when you are wrong, forgiving when you are right, and refusing to be ruled by insults that cannot truly harm you.

### The Death Penalty

**760. Will the death penalty someday disappear from human law?**

Yes. Its abolition will mark genuine progress. When humanity becomes more enlightened, the death penalty will vanish from earth.

But that time is still distant.

Even so, progress can already be seen: in many places its use has been restricted, and justice has become more careful and more humane than in earlier eras.

**761. Doesn’t the right of self-preservation justify eliminating a dangerous member of society?**

No. There are other ways to protect society without killing. And it is essential to leave open the door of repentance, not slam it shut forever.

**762. Wasn’t the death penalty necessary in less advanced times?**

“Necessary” is not the right word. People call something necessary when they have not yet found anything better.

As understanding grows, humanity recognizes past excesses committed in the name of justice and turns away from them.

**763. Is restricting the death penalty a sign of progress?**

Yes—clearly. Doesn’t your heart recoil when you read of the old massacres performed as “justice,” or of torture used to force confessions from the guilty and innocent alike?

If you had lived then, you might have found it normal— and perhaps would have done worse.

This is how “justice” changes across time. Only divine law remains constant. Human law evolves until it is brought into harmony with God’s law.

**764. Jesus said, “Whoever kills by the sword shall perish by the sword.” Doesn’t that endorse the death penalty—the ‘eye for an eye’?**

Be careful. These words have often been misunderstood.

The “law of return” belongs to divine justice— and God applies it, not humans. You live within it constantly: you are taught through consequences in this life or another.

Those who cause suffering will eventually meet suffering in kind. This is what Jesus meant.

And remember: the same Jesus also said, *“Forgive your enemies.”* He taught you to ask forgiveness in the very measure you forgive others. Let these teachings interpret one another.

**765. What about the death penalty imposed “in the name of God”?**

It is an attempt to take God’s place as judge. Those who do this reveal how little they understand the heart of God and how much they still must learn.

To kill in the name of God is a grave misuse of religion— and those who authorize such killings bear responsibility for those deaths.
