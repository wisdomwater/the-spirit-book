## Chapter I — Divine or Natural Law

### The Characteristics of Natural Law

**614. What is meant by natural law?**

Natural law is the quiet, steady guidance of God woven into creation. It is the one law that truly leads us toward a life of wholeness and joy. It shows us what leads to harmony and what leads to harm. Whenever we turn away from this inner compass, we suffer—not as punishment, but as consequence, like wandering from a path and losing our footing.

**615. Is God’s law eternal?**

Yes. God’s law is as unchanging as the One who gives it. It is constant, steady, and trustworthy.

**616. Can God ask of humankind in one era what would be forbidden in another?**

God does not shift or err. It is humanity that must adjust its own rules, because our understanding grows slowly over time. But the laws that sustain both the material and the spiritual universe are rooted in a harmony God established forever.

**617. What do the divine laws encompass? Do they apply to more than moral conduct?**

All the laws of nature—physical, moral, spiritual—are divine, because God is the author of all things. Scientists explore the laws of matter; those seeking spiritual growth explore the laws of the soul.

> *Do humans have the ability to master both the laws of nature and the laws of matter?*

Yes, but not in a single lifetime. Consider the long journey from primitive humanity to the heights of civilization. A few short years—or even a long earthly life—cannot teach all that a soul must learn.

Among divine laws, some govern the movements of matter; these are physical laws, the concern of science. Others speak to our relationship with God and one another— the laws guiding body, heart, and spirit. These are the moral laws.

**618. Are the divine laws the same for all worlds?**

Reason tells us they must be adapted to the unique nature and level of growth of the beings who live in each world.

### The Origin and Knowledge of Natural Law

**619. Has God provided all humans with the means to know divine law?**

Yes. Everyone has access to it, but not everyone understands it immediately. Those who seek with sincerity grasp it more quickly. Yet all will one day understand, for this knowledge is essential for our growth.

Multiple incarnations reveal the justice of God: each new life offers deeper intelligence, a clearer sense of right and wrong. If all learning had to be completed in one lifetime, what fate would await the millions who die in ignorance simply because of the circumstances into which they were born?

**620. Before uniting with a physical body, does the soul understand God’s law more clearly?**

It understands divine law according to its spiritual maturity and carries this understanding as an intuition into earthly life. Yet human impulses, fears, and desires can make us forget.

**621. Where is God’s law written?**

In the conscience.

> *If humans carry this law within, why must it be revealed to them?*

Because we forget. And so God gently reminds us again and again.

**622. Has God entrusted certain individuals with the mission of revealing divine law?**

Yes. In every era, some souls incarnate with a clearer vision and a calling to help humanity progress.

**623. Haven’t some who claimed to teach divine law misled others?**

Yes—many acted from ambition or illusion, believing themselves inspired when they were not. Yet even in their errors, elements of truth could shine through, for their intellect often surpassed their wisdom.

**624. What are the characteristics of true prophets?**

True prophets embody humility and integrity. They speak and act from a sincere communion with God. A person who carries falsehood within cannot be the mouthpiece of divine truth.

**625. What is the perfect model God has offered to humanity?**

Look to Jesus. He is the clearest reflection of divine love and moral purity ever to walk the earth. His teachings flow from the Spirit itself, showing the truest expression of God’s law.

Many who taught religion confused human tradition with divine will, binding people with rules born of fear or control. Jesus revealed the difference between human law and the law that springs from the heart of God.

**626. Were divine laws revealed only through Jesus? Before him, did people know them only by intuition?**

Divine law is written everywhere. From ancient times, wise souls have glimpsed and taught its truths, though often incompletely. Their teachings prepared the soil before Christ sowed the seed. Nature itself bears witness to God’s law for anyone willing to look with sincerity.

**627. Since Jesus taught God’s law, why are the teachings of the Spirits necessary?**

Jesus often spoke in parables suited to his time. Now humanity is ready for clarity. The Spirits expand and illuminate these teachings, awakening the sincere, challenging the proud, and unveiling hypocrisy. Their mission is to prepare the way for the inner Kingdom of God— a kingdom founded entirely on love and charity.

**628. Why hasn’t truth always been accessible to everyone?**

Because truth, like light, must be received gradually. If given all at once, it would overwhelm.

In ancient times, only a few held fragments of sacred knowledge, often wrapped in mystery or symbolism. Yet every tradition carries seeds of truth. Spiritist understanding offers a key to many teachings once seen as contradictory or obscure. We are encouraged to study all wisdom, for each tradition can nourish the soul.

### Good and Evil

**629. How can we define morality?**

Morality is simply the art of choosing what nurtures life and love. It is the ability to discern good from evil and to align ourselves with God’s law, acting for the good of all.

**630. How can we distinguish between good and evil?**

Good is whatever harmonizes with divine law; evil is whatever turns us away from it. When we do what is loving and just, we walk in God’s way. When we injure, exploit, or ignore the good, we step outside of it.

**631. Do humans have the means within themselves to discern good from evil?**

Yes. Faith, sincere seeking, and the intelligence God has given us allow us to recognize the difference.

**632. Since humans are fallible, can they mistake evil for good?**

Not if they follow the simple teaching of Jesus: *“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”* This is the surest guide.

**633. Does this rule apply to our treatment of ourselves as well?**

Yes. When you exceed what your body needs, you suffer. When you ignore the limits of your soul, you suffer spiritually. Natural law whispers “enough”— and if we listened, much of the pain we attribute to fate would dissolve.

**634. Why does moral evil exist at all? Couldn’t God have created us with better instincts?**

Souls are created simple and unknowing. Our journey is one of discovery, learning through experience what leads to life and what leads to suffering. Without contrast, growth would be impossible. The union of spirit and body provides this sacred classroom.

**635. Since people occupy different social conditions with different needs, is natural law still uniform for all?**

Yes. Though our circumstances vary, the core law remains the same. Reason helps us distinguish true needs from the illusions created by culture or desire.

**636. Are good and evil the same for everyone?**

God’s law is universal, yet responsibility varies with understanding. The more clearly we see, the more accountable we become.

**637. Are those who act according to primitive instincts, like cannibals, guilty?**

Guilt depends on intention and understanding. Those who know little are responsible for little. Those who know much are responsible for more.

**638. Sometimes destruction—even of human life—seems necessary. Is this still a violation of divine law?**

Evil remains evil, even when wrapped in necessity. But as the soul evolves, such necessities fade. With greater clarity comes greater responsibility.

**639. When someone commits evil because of the position another has placed them in, who is more culpable?**

The greater burden rests upon the one who caused the harm. Yet all are accountable for both the evil they do and the evil they knowingly enable.

**640. Are those who benefit from evil without committing it equally guilty?**

Yes. To profit from wrongdoing is to silently approve it. It reveals a heart willing to do the same if only circumstances allowed.

**641. Is the desire to do evil as blameworthy as doing it?**

It depends. Resisting temptation when the opportunity presents itself is an act of virtue. But if someone refrains only because they lacked the chance, their heart still bears responsibility.

**642. Is it enough simply to avoid doing harm?**

No. God calls each of us to do as much good as we can. We are responsible not only for the harm we commit but also for the good we withhold.

**643. Are there individuals who truly have no opportunity to do good?**

No. Every encounter is an opportunity— a moment to encourage, comfort, forgive, or serve. Goodness is not limited to charity; it includes every act of usefulness, kindness, and compassion.

**644. Aren’t some surrounded by environments that lead them toward vice and crime?**

Yes, but such environments often represent trials the soul willingly chose before incarnating— opportunities to grow by resisting temptation.

**645. But when immersed in vice, isn’t evil almost irresistible?**

It is tempting, but never irresistible. Even in the darkest places, great virtue can blossom. Some souls enter such environments specifically to be beacons of good.

**646. Does the merit of good deeds depend on certain conditions?**

Yes. The merit lies in the sacrifice. A small act that requires surrender or generosity is worth more than a grand act done without cost. Jesus illustrated this through the widow’s single coin.

### The Divisions of Natural Law

**647. Is the whole law of God contained in the command to love one’s neighbor?**

It is the heart of it, but humanity needs help understanding how this love applies to the many facets of life. Divine law reaches into every circumstance, and vague principles alone are not enough.

**648. What do you think of dividing natural law into ten parts such as worship, labor, reproduction, preservation, destruction, society, progress, equality, liberty, and justice-love-charity?**

This division, inherited from Moses, helpfully touches all aspects of life. Like all systems, it is not absolute, but it offers a useful way to explore the richness of divine law. The final law—justice, love, and charity— is the greatest of all, for it gathers every other law into itself and leads the soul farthest along the path toward God.
