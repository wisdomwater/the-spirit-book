## Chapter XII — Moral Perfection

### Virtues and Vices

**893. Which virtue is the most meritorious of all?**

Every virtue matters, because every virtue is a sign that the soul is moving toward the good. Virtue is present whenever someone *chooses* to resist the pull of harmful tendencies.

But the highest virtue is this: sacrificing personal interest for the good of another—without hidden motives. The greatest merit is the most disinterested charity.

**894. Some people do good spontaneously, without feeling inner conflict. Do they deserve the same merit as those who must struggle against themselves and still overcome?**

Those who do good easily have already fought those battles before. They struggled, they overcame, and the good has become natural to them—like a habit formed through long practice.

You admire them because such goodness is rare on Earth. But on more advanced worlds, what seems exceptional here is simply normal. There, the impulse toward goodness is spontaneous because those worlds are inhabited by good spirits. One bad intention would stand out as a strange exception.

The same can happen on Earth when humanity truly embraces charity—not as a theory, but as a living way.

**895. Beyond obvious vices, what is the clearest sign of imperfection?**

Self-centeredness.

Many moral qualities look strong until they are tested—like thin gold plating that shines until the pressure reveals the cheaper metal beneath. A person may have real admirable traits, and those traits do show progress. But sometimes one touch of self-interest exposes what is still unhealed within.

True selflessness is so rare on Earth that when it appears, people treat it like a marvel.

Attachment to material things is also a clear sign of impurity, because the more someone clings to this world, the less they perceive their deeper destiny. Selflessness, on the other hand, reveals a soul that can see beyond the immediate moment—toward what lasts.

**896. What about people who are generous but lack discernment—who waste their wealth without real benefit because they don’t know how to use it wisely? Do they still have merit?**

They have merit for their selflessness, but not for the good they *could* have done.

Selflessness is a virtue, but careless squandering can still be a lack of judgment. Wealth is not meant to be scattered to the wind—nor locked away in a vault. It is a trust, and one day we give an account not only for what we did, but for what we failed to do: the suffering we could have relieved, the tears we could have dried, the true needs we ignored while giving to those who were not truly needy.

**897. Are people blameworthy if they do good without seeking reward on Earth, but hoping it will improve their situation in the next life?**

We should do good out of charity—freely and selflessly.

* *But isn’t it natural to want to progress and be freed from suffering? If we’re taught that good actions shape our future, is it wrong to hope for a better life ahead?*

No, that hope is not wrong. But those who do good with no ulterior motive—who do it simply to please God and relieve a suffering neighbor—are already more advanced. Their happiness comes sooner, because their hearts are already nearer to love’s true freedom. (See no. 894)

* *Should we distinguish between doing good for others and working to improve ourselves? Is it selfish to correct our defects so we can draw nearer to higher spirits and a better spiritual state?*

No. Improving yourself to draw nearer to God is not selfish—that is the goal for everyone.

What becomes selfish is “keeping score”: calculating each good act like a currency for advantage—whether in this life or the next. But purification, self-mastery, and sincere growth are not self-centered—they are the soul’s return toward its true home.

**898. Since bodily life is brief and the future life is so important, is it worth investing in scientific knowledge that focuses on material things?**

Yes, absolutely.

First, such knowledge helps you serve others. Second, it accelerates the spirit’s development. And between incarnations, the spirit can learn in an hour what would take years on Earth.

No true knowledge is useless. Everything contributes in some way to advancement. Because growth must be made in every direction, each acquired idea—rightly used—helps the spirit mature.

**899. Two wealthy people use their money only for themselves. One was born into luxury; the other rose from hardship. Which is more culpable?**

The one who has known hardship. Having suffered, they understand suffering—and yet they do not relieve it in others. Too often, once comfort arrives, the memory of hardship fades.

**900. Do those who endlessly accumulate wealth without benefiting anyone have a valid excuse if they say it is for their heirs?**

It reveals poor principles.

**901. Two misers: one deprives himself and dies in want atop his treasure; the other is stingy toward others but extravagant toward himself. Which is guiltier?**

The second. He is more selfish. The first has already received part of his punishment in the misery of his own deprivation.

**902. Is it wrong to desire wealth in order to do good?**

No—if the desire is pure. But be honest: is it always truly disinterested? Sometimes the first person we secretly wish to “help” is ourselves.

**903. Is it wrong to study the defects of others?**

It depends on why.

If it is for criticism, mockery, or public exposure, it is wrong—because it lacks charity. If it is for self-application—so you can avoid those same faults—it can be useful.

But remember: tolerance for others’ shortcomings is part of charity. Before criticizing another’s flaw, ask whether the same could be said of you. Then practice the opposite virtue:

* If you criticize greed, practice generosity.
* If you criticize harshness, practice gentleness.
* If you criticize pettiness, practice largeness of spirit.

Live so that Jesus’ warning does not apply: *You notice the speck in your neighbor’s eye, but ignore the beam in your own.*

**904. Is it wrong to probe society’s evils and expose them?**

It depends on the motive.

If someone exposes evil merely to create scandal, they feed corruption rather than heal it. The spirit may even take a secret pleasure in revealing what is dark—and that pleasure carries consequences.

* *How can we judge whether an author’s intention is pure?*

You don’t need to. If the message is good, receive the good. If it is harmful, the author must answer to conscience. And if they wish to prove sincerity, they must embody what they teach.

**905. If an author writes morally uplifting works but does not live by them, will the good done through their writings still count?**

Morality without action is like seed never sown. What use is seed if it never becomes bread?

Such people are more blameworthy because they had the understanding. They offered light to others but refused it for themselves—and so they do not reap the fruit.

**906. Is it wrong to be aware of the good we do and acknowledge it inwardly?**

No. If we can recognize our wrongs, we must also be able to recognize our victories over them. By weighing our actions against God’s law—especially justice, love, and charity—we learn whether we are aligned or drifting.

You may feel healthy satisfaction at overcoming harmful tendencies—so long as you do not become vain. Otherwise, you only trade one fault for another. (See no. 919)

### The Passions

**907. Since passions originate in nature, are they evil in themselves?**

No. Passion becomes harmful only through excess and misuse. The underlying force was given for good. Passions can move people toward great deeds; it is the abuse that turns them into chains.

**908. How can we tell when passions shift from good to harmful?**

Passions are like a horse: valuable when you guide it, dangerous when it guides you.

A passion becomes harmful the moment you stop governing it—especially when it begins to injure you or others.

Passions are levers that can magnify human strength and help fulfill higher purposes. But if you are driven by them rather than directing them, that very power turns on you and crushes you.

Every passion begins in a natural need or sentiment. The root is not evil. It becomes evil through exaggeration—when excess leads to harm.

Whatever draws you toward animal instinct pulls you away from spiritual maturity. Whatever lifts you above instinct reveals spirit’s growing leadership over matter.

**909. Can people always overcome evil tendencies through their own efforts?**

Yes—often with very little effort. What they lack is will. And how few truly try.

**910. Can spirits help us overcome passions?**

Yes. If you sincerely pray to God and your guardian angel, good spirits will come to help—that is part of their mission. (See no. 459)

**911. Aren’t some passions so strong that the will is powerless?**

Many say, “I want to,” but only with their lips. In truth, they are secretly pleased not to overcome the passion, because the spirit still enjoys it.

Those who sincerely try to restrain their passions feel their spiritual nature awakening. Every victory is spirit triumphing over matter.

**912. What is the most effective means of resisting the dominance of the body?**

Practicing self-denial.

### Selfishness

**913. Of all vices, which is the root?**

Selfishness. All evil grows from it.

Look closely at any vice and you will find selfishness at the bottom. You can struggle against symptoms forever, but until the root is pulled, new growth returns. Selfishness is the true plague of society.

Whoever seeks moral perfection must uproot selfishness from the heart, because it cannot coexist with justice, love, and charity—it neutralizes everything else.

**914. Since selfishness is tied to self-interest, can it really be removed from the human heart?**

Yes—but it requires a shift of values. As people awaken to spiritual realities, material things lose some of their power. And human institutions must be reformed—because they often feed selfishness rather than heal it. This is deeply connected to education.

**915. If selfishness is so common, will it always block the reign of goodness on Earth?**

Selfishness is humanity’s great evil, but it is not inherent to the human “species” itself—it reflects the level of purification of the spirits incarnated here.

As spirits grow across successive lives, they shed selfishness as they shed other impurities. Even now, there are people who live without selfishness—more than you think. You simply rarely hear of them, because virtue does not advertise itself.

If there is one, there can be ten. If ten, then a thousand—and so on.

**916. Selfishness seems to increase with civilization. How can the cause destroy the effect?**

Sometimes evil must become obvious before it can be cured. Selfishness has had to show its full destructive power so humanity will finally understand the need to uproot it.

When people are freed from selfishness, they will live as brothers and sisters. The strong will support the weak rather than oppress them. No one will lack what is necessary because justice will be practiced. This is the “kingdom of good” the Spirits are preparing. (See no. 784)

**917. What is the means of destroying selfishness?**

It is the hardest human imperfection to uproot because it is reinforced by material influence—and by your laws, your institutions, and your education.

Selfishness weakens as the moral life rises above the material life—especially through clearer understanding of the soul’s future.

When people truly absorb this larger view of life, the inflated importance of the ego begins to shrink. In that light, Spiritism (as Kardec frames it) directly combats selfishness by widening perspective until the personality no longer feels like the center of everything.

Selfishness is also contagious: people become selfish because they feel others are selfish and they must protect themselves. But if charity and fraternity become the foundation of social life, people will think less of themselves when they see others doing the same. Example becomes medicine.

Today, in a world overflowing with selfishness, true virtue often requires sacrifice for those who may never recognize it. Yet it is to such souls that the deepest blessedness is promised, because the day comes when those who lived only for themselves will feel the emptiness of being alone.

— *Fénelon*

Many sincere efforts have been made to advance humanity. Goodness is honored more publicly now than in many past ages—and yet selfishness still gnaws at society like a devouring worm.

So the work must be done like a physician: return to the causes. Search the structures of life—from family to nation, from poverty to palace—for what excites and sustains selfishness. When the causes are exposed, remedies become clearer.

This takes time, because the causes are many. But it is not impossible.

Above all, the root remedy is education—not merely teaching knowledge, but forming moral character. When the art of shaping character becomes as intentional as the art of shaping intelligence, people will learn to straighten the soul as gardeners train young plants.

And as people come to see that selfishness breeds pride, ambition, greed, envy, hatred, jealousy—disrupting trust and poisoning relationships—they will recognize that selfishness is incompatible with happiness and even with safety. Then, out of enlightened self-interest, they will fight it as they fight a plague.

Selfishness is the source of all vices; charity is the source of all virtues. To weaken the first and strengthen the second is the path to happiness—now and beyond.

### The Characteristics of a Moral Person

**918. By what signs can we recognize real progress that raises a spirit in the spiritual order?**

A spirit shows true progress when the actions of earthly life embody God’s law—and when the person already lives with awareness of the spiritual life to come.

Truly moral individuals practice justice, love, and charity with sincerity and completeness. They examine themselves and ask:

* Have I violated love or justice?
* Have I knowingly done harm?
* Have I done the good that was within my reach?
* Does anyone have a rightful complaint against me?
* Have I treated others as I would want to be treated?

Those who live in charity do good without bargaining for reward. They sacrifice self-interest for justice.

They are humane and kind to all, seeing brothers and sisters in every human being—beyond race, belief, or social rank.

If they possess power or wealth, they regard it as a trust—a deposit to be used for good—without vanity, remembering that what God gives can also be taken away.

If others are placed under their care, they treat them with gentleness, recognizing equality before God. They use authority to uplift, never to crush.

They are tolerant of weakness, remembering their own need for mercy, and keeping close the words: *Let the one without sin cast the first stone.*

They do not seek revenge. They forgive and remember benefits more than injuries, knowing they will be forgiven as they forgive.

And finally, they respect in others all natural rights, as they wish their own rights to be respected.

### Self-Knowledge

**919. What is the most effective means of improving ourselves and resisting the pull of evil?**

An ancient sage said: *Know thyself.* (Socrates.)

* *But how do we actually do that?*

Do as I did when I lived on Earth: at the end of each day, examine your conscience. Review what you did. Ask yourself:

* Did I fail in a duty?
* Did I give anyone reason to complain about me?
* What was my aim in what I did today?
* Would I blame this action if someone else had done it?
* Is there anything I did that I would not dare openly admit?
* If God called me right now into the spirit world—where nothing is hidden—would I shrink under honest gaze?

Examine what you have done against God, against your neighbor, and against yourself. Your answers will bring either peace to conscience or a clear direction for correction.

Self-knowledge is the key to inner change.

* *But how do we judge ourselves honestly when vanity distorts everything?*

Use a test that rarely fails: judge your own actions as if they belonged to someone else. If you would condemn it in another, it cannot be right in you—God does not use two measures.

Also, do not ignore what others think of you. Even your enemies can serve as a mirror, because they have little interest in flattering you. Sometimes God permits them near you to reveal truths a friend might soften.

So let those who truly want to improve uproot their faults like weeds from a garden. Let them balance their moral day like merchants count profit and loss.

If you can say your day has been good, you can sleep in peace—and wait without fear for awakening in the next life.

Do not be afraid to ask yourself clear and precise questions. A few minutes devoted to eternal well-being is not excessive. You labor daily to provide rest in old age—how much more is it worth laboring for the peace of the soul?

Many say, “The present is certain, the future uncertain.” That is precisely the fog we have been sent to lift—so you may understand the future clearly enough that doubt no longer rules your heart. This is why the teaching was given, and why this book has been dictated.

— *St. Augustine*

Many of our wrongs pass unnoticed simply because we do not examine ourselves. St. Augustine’s method helps because it demands direct answers, leaving little room for self-deception. And over time, the sum of those honest answers reveals the true shape of the soul—what must be healed, and what is already growing toward light.
