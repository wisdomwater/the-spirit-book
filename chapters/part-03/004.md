## Chapter IV — The Law of Reproduction

### The Global Population

**686. Is the reproduction of living beings a law of nature?**

Yes—quite clearly. Without reproduction, embodied life would gradually disappear. It is one of the fundamental rhythms through which the physical world continues.

**687. If population growth continues as it has, will the earth one day become overcrowded?**

No. God has already accounted for this and continually maintains balance. Nothing in creation is unnecessary or accidental. Humans often worry because they see only one corner of the picture, while the harmony of the whole remains hidden from view.

### The Succession and Perfecting of the Races

**688. Some human races appear to be diminishing. Will they eventually disappear entirely from the earth?**

Yes—but others will take their place, just as future ones will one day take the place of those living now.

**689. Are modern humans a new creation, or are they perfected descendants of primitive beings?**

They are the same spirits returning again and again, learning and refining themselves through new bodies. Though progress has been made, perfection is still far off.

Just as earlier races gave way to those more developed, so too will the present human race one day decline and be replaced by others who are more advanced. These future races will emerge from today’s humanity, just as today’s civilizations arose from primitive beginnings.

**690. From a physical standpoint, were human bodies specially created, or did they evolve through reproduction?**

The origins of the human body are lost in the depths of time. Yet all humans belong to one great family. Whatever the earliest forms were, they eventually intermingled and gave rise to new variations and expressions.

**691. Physically speaking, what distinguishes primitive races most clearly?**

Their emphasis on physical strength rather than intellectual development. In contrast, modern humanity relies more on intelligence than brute force— and accomplishes far more by learning to harness the forces of nature instead of being dominated by them.

**692. Is improving animal and plant species through science contrary to natural law? Would it be better to let nature take its course?**

No. Everything in creation moves toward greater refinement and harmony. Humans themselves are instruments through which God works to bring creation toward that goal.

To cooperate with perfection is to cooperate with the divine intention.

- *But if people pursue such improvements mainly for personal comfort or gain,  
does that reduce their merit?*

What matters most is that progress occurs. Merit depends on intention—but even when intentions are mixed, the work itself still develops intelligence and understanding. In this growth, humans receive their greatest benefit.

### Obstacles to Reproduction

**693. Are human laws or customs that hinder reproduction contrary to natural law?**

Anything that unnecessarily obstructs the flow of nature works against the broader natural order.

- *But some species—animal or plant—could become harmful  
if they reproduced without restraint. Would it be wrong to limit them?*

God has given humans a unique role: to act consciously as a balancing force within nature. Reproduction may be guided according to real needs, but it should never be hindered capriciously or selfishly.

Human intelligence is meant to restore equilibrium, not disrupt it. Animals also play a role in this balance through instinct— even the instinct to destroy serves the purpose of preventing dangerous overpopulation. Humans differ in that they act with awareness and responsibility.

**694. What should we think of methods used to prevent reproduction solely to satisfy sensual pleasure?**

They reveal a life governed more by the body than by the soul and show how deeply one may become entangled in material concerns.

### Marriage and Celibacy

**695. Is marriage—the lasting union of two individuals— contrary to the law of nature?**

No. Marriage represents an advance in human moral and social development.

**696. What would happen to society if marriage were abolished?**

Humanity would regress toward an animal-like state.

Unregulated and temporary unions belong to humanity’s earliest phase. Marriage marks a step forward, creating stability, responsibility, and mutual solidarity. For this reason, some form of marriage exists in every culture, even if expressed differently.

To abolish it would be to return to infancy as a species— falling below even some animals that form lasting bonds.

**697. Is the absolute indissolubility of marriage a law of nature?**

No. It is a human law—and one that often contradicts natural law. Human laws may evolve; natural laws do not.

**698. Is voluntary celibacy a state of perfection that is pleasing to God?**

No—when it is motivated by selfishness. Such celibacy displeases God and misleads others.

**699. But what of those who choose celibacy in order to devote themselves fully to serving others?**

That is very different. Any personal sacrifice made sincerely for the good of others is meritorious—and the greater the sacrifice, the greater the merit.

God does not contradict divine law. Celibacy in itself is not superior to family life, but it becomes spiritually meaningful when it represents a conscious renunciation undertaken for the sake of compassion and service.

Every sacrifice offered without selfish motive raises a person above mere material living.

### Polygamy

**700. Does the near numerical equality of men and women indicate how they are meant to unite?**

Yes. Everything in nature reflects intention and balance.

**701. Which is more in harmony with natural law: polygamy or monogamy?**

Monogamy. Polygamy is a human institution shaped by particular customs, and its gradual disappearance marks social and moral progress.

In God’s view, marriage is meant to rest on mutual love. Polygamy replaces love with possession and desire.

If polygamy were natural law, it would exist everywhere— yet it cannot, because the sexes are equal in number. It is therefore a temporary social arrangement, not a divine principle, and will fade as humanity matures toward deeper love and equality.
