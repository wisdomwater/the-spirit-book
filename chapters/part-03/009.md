## Chapter IX — The Law of Equality

### Natural Equality

**803. Are all people equal before God?**

Yes. All are moving toward the same destination, and God’s laws are made for everyone without exception. When you say, “The sun shines on everyone,” you’re speaking a deep spiritual truth—God’s care is not parceled out by status, origin, or reputation.

All are subject to the same natural laws. All are born fragile. All endure suffering. And in the end, the body of the rich returns to the earth just as surely as the body of the poor. God grants no natural superiority through birth, and none through death. Before God, all are equal.

### The Inequality of Aptitudes

**804. Why hasn’t God endowed everyone with the same aptitudes?**

God creates spirits equal at their origin. But spirits have not all lived the same length of time, nor gained the same experience. Over many lives, some develop more quickly—through effort, choice, and the way they use their free will.

This diversity is not favoritism; it is part of the design. A variety of aptitudes is needed so that each person can contribute something meaningful within the limits of their abilities. What one cannot do, another can—and in this way everyone has a purpose and a place.

And because worlds are linked in solidarity, inhabitants of more advanced worlds—often formed long before yours—may come here to serve as examples and catalysts for growth. (See no. 361)

**805. When a spirit comes from a more evolved world to a less evolved one, does it keep what it has learned?**

Yes. A spirit who has progressed does not lose that progress. In spirit life, it may choose a more difficult circumstance or a more limited “outer condition,” but not as a punishment—rather as a lesson, a service, and a means of further growth. (See no. 180)

So differences in aptitude do not come from unequal creation. They come from differing degrees of development. God permits those degrees to mingle so that the more advanced can help the less advanced—and so that everyone learns the deep truth of charity: we belong to one another.

### Social Inequalities

**806. Is inequality of social condition a law of nature?**

No. It is the work of human beings, not the work of God.

> *Will this inequality someday disappear?*

Only God’s laws are eternal. Human arrangements change—and you can already see inequalities slowly eroding over time. They are destined to fade as pride and selfishness lose their grip, leaving only differences of true merit.

A day will come when the great family of God’s children will no longer speak of “purer” or “less pure” blood. Only the spirit carries purity or impurity—and that has nothing to do with social rank.

**807. What about those who abuse their social superiority to oppress the weak for personal gain?**

They are pitiable. They will experience oppression in turn, and they will return to a life in which they feel what they once inflicted. (See no. 684)

### The Inequality of Wealth

**808. Doesn’t inequality of wealth arise from inequality of abilities—since some can acquire more than others?**

Yes—and no. What, then, of fraud and theft?

> *Is inherited wealth therefore always the fruit of wrongdoing?*

You cannot assume that. You would have to examine its origins. Was it gained through injustice or exploitation? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But even if wealth is honestly acquired, God also looks at the inner posture: the craving for wealth, the secret impatience to possess it quickly, the restless hunger that can never say “enough.” Divine judgment weighs not only the visible act, but the hidden motive—and it is often more severe than human judgment.

**809. If a fortune was wrongly acquired at its origin, are heirs responsible?**

Not for the wrongdoing itself—especially if they do not know. But wealth often arrives in someone’s hands as an opportunity to repair what was broken before them. Blessed are those who recognize this.

If they restore what was taken, or relieve harm done, that repair can be counted for the good of everyone involved—because it is often the original wrongdoer, from the spirit world, who inspires the heir toward reparation.

**810. Since one can distribute wealth more or less justly without violating human law, are we morally responsible for what we arrange after death?**

Yes. Every action bears fruit. The fruit of goodness is sweet; the fruit of selfishness is bitter. Remember this always.

**811. Is absolute equality of wealth possible? Has it ever existed?**

No. It is not possible. Differences of character and ability would break it again almost immediately.

> *But some believe equality of wealth would remedy all social ills—what do you think?*

Either they are dreaming in abstractions, or they are moved by ambition and envy. Equality would be undone by the force of reality. Do not chase fantasies. Fight selfishness—that is the true social plague.

**812. If equality of wealth is impossible, is equality of well-being also impossible?**

Well-being is relative, but in a healthier society everyone could share in it more fully—if people understood one another.

True well-being is not simply possessing things. It is being able to use one’s time in a way that fits one’s nature, rather than being forced into work one hates. Since people have different aptitudes, useful work would still be done—and balance would naturally emerge. Harmony exists in everything; it is humans who disrupt it.

> *Is it possible for everyone to understand one another?*

Yes—when they practice the law of justice.

**813. Some fall into poverty through their own fault. Is society responsible?**

Yes. Society is the primary cause of such wrongs. Has society not neglected moral education? Often it is poor formation—distorted values, neglected guidance—that warps judgment instead of healing harmful tendencies. (See no. 685)

### The Trials of Wealth and Poverty

**814. Why has God given wealth and power to some, and poverty to others?**

To test each person in different ways. And often, these trials are chosen by the spirits themselves—who frequently fail the very test they asked for.

**815. Which is more dangerous: poverty or wealth?**

Both are dangerous. Poverty can provoke bitterness and resentment toward Providence. Wealth can lead to excess, indulgence, and moral blindness.

**816. If the wealthy face more temptations, don’t they also have more opportunities to do good?**

Yes—and that is precisely why the test is severe. Too often they do not use their means for good. They become selfish, proud, and insatiable. Desire expands with fortune, and the heart forgets how to say, “This is enough.”

High position and power over others is as great a trial as suffering. The more wealth and influence we have, the more obligations we carry—and the more capacity we have to bless or to harm. God tests the poor through the spirit of resignation, and the rich through the spirit of stewardship.

Wealth and power can awaken passions that bind us to the material world and slow spiritual maturity. This is why Jesus spoke so sharply about riches: not because money itself is evil, but because attachment can become a prison. (See no. 266)

### Equality of Rights Between Men and Women

**817. Are men and women equal before God, with the same rights?**

Yes. God has given both the knowledge of good and evil, and the capacity to grow.

**818. Where does the moral inferiority of women in certain societies come from?**

From injustice—specifically the cruel domination men have exercised over women. It is the result of social systems and the abuse of strength over weakness. Among those who are morally immature, force is mistaken for right.

**819. Why are women physically weaker than men?**

To fit a diversity of roles: men for heavier labor, women for lighter work—yet both support one another through the trials of a life that carries real hardship.

**820. Does physical weakness make women naturally dependent on men?**

No. God gives strength to some so they may protect the vulnerable—not to enslave them.

God has suited each sex to its functions. If women have been given less physical force, they have also been given greater sensitivity, attuned to motherhood and the tenderness required to care for fragile life.

**821. Are the functions given to women as important as those given to men?**

Yes—indeed, in a certain sense, even greater. Women give men their first lessons in life.

**822. Since all are equal before God’s law, should they not be equal before human law?**

Yes. This is the foundation of justice: do not do to others what you would not want done to you.

> *So for human law to be fully just, must it consecrate equal rights between men and women?*

Equality of rights, yes. Equality of functions, no. Each has a place, and roles should match aptitude. But any special privilege granted to one sex and denied to the other violates justice.

The liberation of women moves with civilization; their servitude keeps pace with barbarity. And remember: sex belongs to the body, not the spirit. Spirits may incarnate as either—there is no essential spiritual hierarchy between them. Therefore, they must share the same rights.

### Equality in Death

**823. Where does the desire to perpetuate one’s memory through grand funeral monuments come from?**

From pride—often the last act of pride.

> *But isn’t funeral pomp usually chosen by relatives, not the deceased?*

Often yes—and it is still pride. Many displays are not truly for the departed, but for vanity, social standing, and the desire to parade wealth.

Do you think the poor love less deeply because they can only place one flower on a grave? Do you believe marble prevents forgetfulness for someone who was useless while living?

**824. Is funeral pomp always blameworthy?**

No. When it honors a truly moral life, it can be just—and it can offer a good example.

Death levels every human distinction. The grave is the meeting place where titles, status, and privilege fall away. Time will crumble monuments just as it dissolves bodies—nature wills it so. What lasts is not stone, but the memory of one’s deeds. No amount of ceremony can cleanse a life of meanness, nor raise a soul in the spirit’s true order. (See nos. 320 ff.)
