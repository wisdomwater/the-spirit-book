Some objections raised against Spiritism come from thoughtful people observing real difficulties. These objections deserve patient and honest consideration.

One common concern is the tone and quality of messages received from certain spirits. Some communications seem shallow, foolish, or unworthy of beings from a higher realm. But the Doctrine itself tells us: spirits are not all equal. They differ in wisdom, in development, and in morality. Some are luminous and noble; others are still childish or misguided. Just as in human society, not every voice carries the same clarity or truth.

It is therefore the responsibility of discerning people to separate what is wise from what is trivial. Those who have only encountered the lower, mischievous, or immature spirits may mistakenly assume that all spirits are of that kind. It is simply that they have never stepped beyond the outskirts of the spiritual world.

We need not assume these individuals attracted only lower spirits because of some moral failing. More often, it is that their interest was mixed with curiosity rather than sincere growth—and lower spirits are drawn to such energy. Higher spirits seek seriousness, harmony, and moral purpose. If they do not find it, they quietly withdraw.

It would be unfair to judge the entire spirit world based on the behavior of its lowest ranks. That would be like entering a great city through one of its poorest neighborhoods and concluding that the whole population is dishonest or uncultured. The noble and wise are present—but we must look in the right places.

If anyone wonders, “Do higher spirits truly communicate with us?” the answer is simple: *Come and see.* Don’t stay on the margins. Observe carefully, patiently, and with an open heart. The evidence is available, though it is invisible to those who refuse to look—those of whom Jesus said, “They have eyes but do not see; they have ears but do not hear.”

Another version of this objection claims that all spirit communications are the work of a single malevolent being—that every manifestation is merely a deception. But this idea collapses quickly under its own weight. If that were true, we would be forced to believe that evil is sometimes wise, moral, compassionate, and uplifting. And if a devil can speak goodness, then the idea of “evil spirits only” loses all meaning.

More importantly, such a belief contradicts both reason and faith. Would God allow only harmful voices to reach humanity, without permitting any guidance from good and loving spirits? If God *could not* stop such deception, then God would not be all-powerful. If God *could* stop it but chose not to, then God would not be good. Either conclusion is incompatible with the divine nature.

And finally, to claim that evil spirits communicate is already to admit that spirit communication exists. Once that doorway is open, it must be understood that nothing occurs without God’s permission. And if God permits communication, it is unthinkable that only harmful voices would be allowed through.

The presence of both good and less-evolved spirits is not something to fear. It simply reflects the same reality we see in human life: a wide spectrum of growth, wisdom, and character. Our task is to cultivate discernment, seek higher guidance, and remain anchored in goodness.
