Over time, people began to realize that the baskets and planchettes were merely tools—extensions of the medium’s hand. Soon, mediums found that even without these devices, their hands would begin to move on their own, guided by a force they did not direct. The writing came quickly, often in bursts of energy, and communication grew easier and more complete. This direct writing is now the most common form, and the number of people who possess this sensitivity grows every day.

Experience eventually revealed many forms of mediumship. Messages could come not only through writing, but also through speech, inner hearing, sight, impressions, touch, and even through writings that appeared without a medium’s hand at all. These discoveries made it clear that the phenomenon was larger and more varied than anyone had first imagined.

Once this was established, a deeper question arose: *What role does the medium actually play?* Are responses shaped by the medium’s own thoughts, or does something independent speak through them?

Two observations help clarify the matter.

First, when mediums rest their fingertips lightly on a basket or planchette, the object moves in ways that cannot reasonably be directed by them. This becomes especially clear when several people touch the instrument at once. For them all to unconsciously coordinate their movements to produce coherent answers would require an almost superhuman precision of mind and body. Even more telling, the handwriting changes depending on the spirit who communicates; the same hand adopts completely different writing styles—styles that recur whenever that same spirit returns. For this to be a mere trick, the medium would need to flawlessly imitate dozens of writing styles and remember each one on command.

Second, the content of the messages often goes far beyond the medium’s own knowledge. Many responses address complex philosophical or scientific questions that the medium could neither anticipate nor understand. Sometimes the medium doesn’t even know what question has been asked, because the questioner poses it silently or in a foreign language—and the answer comes back in that same language. At other times the instrument writes spontaneously, offering reflections on topics that no one present had mentioned.

The tone of these communications varies greatly. Some messages carry wisdom, compassion, and clarity—words that lift the heart and reveal a higher moral intelligence. Others are trivial, playful, or shallow. Such diversity strongly suggests that the intelligences involved are not all of the same order. If the character of the messages differs so widely, the source of those messages must differ as well.

Who, then, are these communicating intelligences? Are they human spirits? Something else? These are the questions that this book seeks to answer, drawing on the explanations given by the Spirits themselves.

The effects we are considering are not hidden or rare. They occur openly, in daylight, among countless people in many places. They are not the privilege of one gifted person but are repeated daily around the world. Since these events display intention and intelligence, they must arise from something more than a physical mechanism.

Many theories have been proposed, and we will examine them carefully. But for now, let us take the simplest step: accept, provisionally, the existence of beings distinct from humankind, since that is the explanation these intelligences themselves offer. And let us listen, with humility and discernment, to what they have to say.
