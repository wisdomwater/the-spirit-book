## XI

Some critics find it odd that many spirit communications involve well-known figures from history, and they ask why these seem to be the ones who appear most often. But this impression comes from a very limited view of the facts. In truth, most of the spirits who manifest are completely unknown. They often choose symbolic names or titles that reflect their character rather than their earthly identity.

When we deliberately call upon a spirit—aside from loved ones or personal acquaintances—it is only natural that we would invoke names familiar to us. And when a recognized figure appears, people take notice simply because the name stands out. The countless unknown spirits who visit go largely unnoticed.

Some also wonder why the spirits of great or accomplished individuals would respond so simply, or why they concern themselves with matters that seem small compared to what they once did in life. But this question dissolves once we understand a deeper truth: earthly status does not determine spiritual rank.

In the spirit world, the power, fame, and honors that people enjoyed on earth hold no weight. When we cross the threshold of death, we leave all earthly titles behind. Only the soul remains—its character, its humility, its love, its wisdom.

And in that world, the words of Jesus take on their fullest meaning: “The first shall be last, and the last shall be first.”

The person who stood proudly at the top of society may find themselves at the very bottom in the spiritual hierarchy. A king may be below the rank of a soldier he once commanded. A celebrated mind may discover that simple hearts surpassed him long ago in purity, gentleness, and compassion.

So it is not surprising at all that spirits of once-famous individuals respond to our call with humility and simplicity. Many who were powerful in this life return as learners in the next. Their greatness was of the earth, not of eternity.

In the spirit world, only one thing matters: who we have become.
