Some skeptics point to the spelling mistakes in certain spirit communications as though this were a decisive argument. We would ignore this objection entirely if it did not open the door to a deeper and more meaningful insight.

It is true that not all spirit messages are perfectly spelled. But it is unreasonable to claim this proves the spirits are ignorant or unworthy of trust. Even the most learned people on earth occasionally misspell words—and such slips do not diminish their insight or wisdom.

But there is a more important truth beneath this: For spirits, especially those of higher order, the idea is everything; the form is almost nothing.

Freed from the heaviness of matter, spirits communicate with one another at the speed of thought. Their language is not made of syllables and letters—it is a direct sharing of consciousness. When such beings turn toward us and use human language, they must clothe their thoughts in the slow, limited structure of earthly words. This, for them, is cumbersome, imperfect, and inadequate—much like a poet being forced to compose in a crude or restrictive dialect.

They have said as much themselves.
It is fascinating to watch how they navigate this limitation, finding ways to express expansive ideas through a tool not built for the depth or nuance of their thought.

In some ways, we experience something similar: a mind full of insight while the hand strains to keep up. The higher the spirit, the more they feel the burden of compressing their ideas into our narrow linguistic forms.

This is why they care so little for minor spelling errors—especially when sharing truths of depth and significance. Their concern is the essence, not the ornament.

And yet, despite this limitation, there is something remarkable: Spirits can communicate in any human language with equal fluency, understanding all of them instantly.

Poetry dictated through a medium often carries beauty, rhythm, and precision—even when the medium knows nothing of poetic form. The message shines with a refinement that satisfies even the most demanding literary critic.

This alone should remind us: the spirit world does not stumble over the surface of words the way we do. It moves with freedom—toward meaning, toward truth, toward the living heart of the message.
