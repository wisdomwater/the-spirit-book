## IV

If the phenomena had remained nothing more than the movement of objects, the discussion could have stayed within the realm of physics. But that is not what happened. Something stranger began to shine through—something that hinted at intention, awareness, even personality. Soon it became clear that the force moving these objects was not blind or mechanical. It responded. It reacted. It showed signs of intelligence.

This possibility opened an entirely new horizon. If an intelligent cause was involved, what was it? Where did it come from? Was it human? Was it something beyond humanity? A new set of questions naturally arose from the first.

The earliest intelligent replies were simple. People would agree that a single tap meant “yes,” and two taps meant “no,” and the table—of its own accord—would answer the questions asked. Skeptics, of course, dismissed this as coincidence. But the answers grew more precise. Soon the responses were given through letters of the alphabet: the table would tap once for A, twice for B, and so on. Letter by letter, words and sentences appeared—coherent, relevant, and far too specific to be brushed away as chance.

When asked what was giving these replies, the unseen communicator answered plainly: it was a spirit. It gave its name. It shared details. This is significant, because no one had proposed spirits as an explanation beforehand. The idea did not arise from human speculation. It arose from the phenomena themselves.

Still, this method of communication was slow and tiring. Then came another breakthrough—one that unfolded in the same way in different countries at the same time. One of the invisible intelligences suggested attaching a pencil to a small basket or similar object. When placed on paper, under the light touch of a person’s hand, the basket began to move—and the pencil wrote. Not random marks, but full words, flowing sentences, entire pages of moral and philosophical discourse. Written swiftly, as though guided by an unseen hand.

In Paris, on June 10, 1853, a devoted practitioner of spirit communication received this precise instruction: *“Go into the next room and bring the little basket. Attach a pencil to it. Place it on the paper with your fingers resting on the edge.”* He obeyed. Moments later, the basket moved, and the pencil wrote clearly: *“I strictly forbid you from telling anyone what I have just told you; next time I will write better.”*

It soon became clear that the instrument itself did not matter—basket, board, or any small object would do. What mattered was the invisible influence guiding it. This is how many came to use the device later known as the planchette.

But the planchette would not move for just anyone. It responded only through certain individuals endowed with a particular sensitivity. These people came to be called mediums—bridges between the seen and unseen worlds. The conditions behind this ability involve both physical and moral elements, many of which remain mysterious even now. Mediums appear in all ages, all backgrounds, all levels of education. And with time and practice, the ability can grow stronger.
