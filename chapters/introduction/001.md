When a new understanding begins to emerge in the world, it often needs a new vocabulary. Fresh language helps us see clearly and keeps us from confusing old meanings with new insights. Words like *spiritual*, *spiritualist*, and *spiritualism* already carry long histories and well-defined meanings. If we tried to use them in a new way to describe the teachings of the Spirits, we would only add to the ambiguity that already surrounds conversations about the soul.

By common usage, *spiritualism* is simply the opposite of materialism. Anyone who believes there is more to a human being than flesh and bone could be called a spiritualist. But that alone does not mean a person believes in the existence of spirits or in the possibility of communicating with the unseen world.

For that reason, new words were chosen—*Spiritism* and *Spiritist*. These names point directly to their source and their purpose. They describe a way of seeing the soul’s relationship with the invisible realm, a world inhabited by conscious beings we call spirits. Those who embrace this teaching are called Spiritists. This allows the older terms to remain connected to their broader philosophical meanings without confusion.

In a focused sense, *The Spirits’ Book* lays out the foundation of the Spiritist Doctrine. In a wider sense, its teachings still belong within the larger family of spiritualist thought, which is why the subtitle reads: **A Spiritualist Philosophy**.
