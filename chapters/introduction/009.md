## IX

That inert objects can move under unseen influence is no longer in question. The real question is deeper: *Does this movement contain intelligence?* And if so, *what is the source of that intelligence?*

To explore this clearly, it helps to set aside, for the moment, the more dramatic forms of communication—spoken messages, direct writing through a medium’s hand, or the subtle impressions received inwardly. These forms, though convincing to those who study them seriously, may seem too intertwined with the medium’s own mind for someone encountering such things for the first time.

So let us focus on something simpler: the writing produced by a pencil attached to an object—a basket, a planchette, or any similar device. The medium’s fingers rest lightly on the object, yet the movements required to form words show no sign of conscious guidance. Even if one were to suppose that an exceptionally skilled person might deceive a careful observer, the *content* of these writings presents a far greater challenge.

How does one explain pages of writing that flow rapidly and eloquently on subjects the medium knows nothing about? How does one account for poetry of such refinement and purity—poetry that rivals the best human writers—pouring forth from the hand of someone untrained, uneducated, or even a child? And how does one explain the fact that these writings are appearing in many places across the world, through countless mediums, all sharing similar themes, wisdom, and insight?

Are these events real? The only honest answer is simple: Observe. Watch patiently. Give it time. There are plenty of opportunities to witness such things. But they require sustained observation, sincere intention, and conditions that allow the phenomenon to manifest naturally.

How have skeptics responded? Some say, “It is deception—either trickery or self-delusion.” Let us consider this fairly.

Fraud is unlikely when there is nothing to gain. Deception requires motive, coordination, and reward. Yet these phenomena appear among people who profit nothing from them—people of character, seriousness, and education. And if this were fraud, how strange it would be that such “fraud” appears everywhere at once, across nations, languages, and cultures, producing similar expressions, similar ideas, similar wisdom. How would children participate in such a deception? How would people with no shared contact coordinate their “tricks” across continents?

If mediums are not simply passive tools, then critics must also assume that these ordinary people possess knowledge, eloquence, and abilities far beyond their upbringing or education—an unlikely explanation.

Others claim, “Even if there is no fraud, everyone involved may be under a shared illusion.” But then we must ask: Who are the witnesses? Are Spiritists merely the easily deceived—the naïve, the uneducated? Or do they include thoughtful people, people with strong moral character, people who take great care before accepting any new idea?

Spiritism today includes millions of followers across the world—among them scholars, professionals, thinkers, and people of insight who have nothing to gain from accepting an error, and who have no time to waste on foolishness. Their testimony does not *prove* the phenomena, but it shows that intelligent, reflective people find something truly worthy of attention in them.

The idea that only skeptics hold common sense—or that all believers are simple or misguided—is not a sign of reason but of pride. It dismisses dialogue before it even begins.

To the thoughtful, the careful, and the open-hearted, the consistency of these testimonies becomes a meaningful indication, inviting deeper study rather than careless dismissal.
