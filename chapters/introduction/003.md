Like every new way of seeing the world, the Spiritist Doctrine has gathered both friends and critics. Our intention here is not to persuade those who are determined to reject anything new before listening. There will always be people who believe that light was made only for them. Instead, the hope is to speak to those who approach with sincerity—those without rigid opinions, who simply want to understand. Many objections to Spiritism arise not from careful study but from quick, incomplete observations. When the picture is only half-seen, judgment comes too quickly.

To begin, it helps to recall the series of events that gave rise to the Doctrine.

The earliest and most widespread phenomenon was the movement of objects—most famously, the turning of tables. Though these events became widely known in America, history tells us that such occurrences are ancient and have appeared in many places and eras. Alongside the movement of objects, people also observed mysterious knocks and sounds that seemed to arise without any identifiable cause. From America, these strange happenings spread rapidly through Europe and across the world. Skepticism was natural at first, yet the sheer number of experiences soon left little doubt that something real was taking place.

If the movements had been gentle or predictable, they might have been brushed aside as effects of some hidden physical force. After all, we do not yet know all of nature’s laws. Electricity, for example, continues to reveal new and surprising powers—powers that reshape science with every generation. So it was not unreasonable to wonder whether some altered form of electricity, influenced by unknown conditions, might be enough to move an object. The fact that groups of people produced stronger results even seemed to support this idea, as though the participants formed a kind of living battery.

Circular motion in itself is not unusual; everything in the cosmos moves in vast spirals and orbits. Perhaps, some thought, this was simply a small reflection of the universe’s great currents. But the movements of these objects were not always circular. They could be abrupt, forceful, unpredictable—tables shaking, lifting, tilting, even rising against the known laws of weight and balance. Yet even this could be attributed, at least hypothetically, to an invisible physical force. After all, electricity is capable of uprooting trees, toppling buildings, and hurling heavy objects great distances.

Even the mysterious raps and noises could be attributed to some unknown manifestation of a natural fluid or force. Extraordinary as they seemed, none of these early events required invoking anything beyond the realm of physics.

And yet, despite the value such mysteries could have offered to science, scholars often ignored them. The reason is almost embarrassing in its simplicity: the phenomenon involved something as ordinary as a table. The very commonness of the object caused many to dismiss the experience before even looking. Human pride, not reason, stood in the way. If frogs had twitched in response to electrical currents in a village parlor rather than in Galvani’s laboratory, and if people had called it “the dance of the frogs,” even that great discovery might have been dismissed as childish trickery.

Still, some individuals remained humble enough to acknowledge that nature might hold secrets they had not yet learned. They chose to observe the phenomena for themselves. But they often approached with fixed expectations. If the events did not unfold on command or according to their preferred methods, they concluded the whole thing was false. Yet the tables moved regardless of their disbelief—echoing Galileo’s quiet insistence, “And yet, it moves.” The phenomena continued to spread, multiplying across the world, and demanded a rational explanation rather than mockery or denial.

To dismiss a phenomenon simply because it cannot be replicated at will is not fair reasoning. Even the sciences we trust—electricity, chemistry, magnetism—depend on specific conditions. Would we deny their existence when those conditions are absent? Why should it be surprising that a new category of phenomena might require new laws and new ways of observing?

Another common objection is the claim of fraud. Certainly, some cases may involve deception—humans are capable of mischief. But is every unexplained event a trick? Often, people label something “fraud” simply because they cannot understand it, much as uneducated onlookers might see a scientist’s experiment as nothing but sleight of hand. And even if fraud exists, is that a reason to deny the genuine phenomenon? We do not reject physics because a stage magician imitates it.

Furthermore, consider the scale. Could mere trickery be responsible for similar events in countless places, among people of good character, wisdom, and high standing? A prank may last for a moment—but a worldwide, sustained, cross-cultural practical joke would be more astonishing than the phenomenon itself.
