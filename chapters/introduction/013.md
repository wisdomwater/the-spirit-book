These reflections lead naturally to another difficulty: Why do spirits sometimes give different, even contradictory, answers?

The answer begins with a simple truth: spirits vary widely in their level of knowledge, goodness, and maturity. Just as on earth, a scholar, an uneducated person, and a playful trickster will not answer a question in the same way, so too with spirits. What matters most is *who* we are speaking with.

But what about disagreements among high spirits—those who are wiser, nobler, and more evolved? Why do even they sometimes seem to differ?

First, spiritual truth is vast, subtle, and woven into realities far beyond our immediate grasp. Our questions—often shaped by our limited perspective—can only receive answers shaped to our capacity. Many influences affect how a message is formed and expressed, regardless of the spirit’s advancement. This is why study requires patience, continuity, and humility. We do not become doctors or scholars in a few hours, and the realms of the spirit are infinitely larger still. A world this wide cannot be understood quickly.

Second, what appears to be contradiction often fades when we look more deeply. Human beings disagree constantly, even within the same field of study, often because they use different terminology or describe the same truth from different angles. The apparent differences are usually linguistic or conceptual—not essential.

The same is true of spirit communications.
Much depends on *how the question is asked*. Spirits of higher order do not concern themselves with phrasing or form. They speak in essence and intention. When our language is imprecise or our concepts limited, answers may appear to vary even when the core message is the same.

Consider the word *soul*. Its meanings on earth are many. Ask a group of people to define it and you will hear: the spark of life, the animating principle, something inside, something outside, the seat of consciousness, the breath of God. Are these contradictions, or simply different ways of speaking about the same mystery?

The same applies to the way spirits speak of God. Some say “the Principle of all things,” others “the Creator,” “the Supreme Intelligence,” “the Infinite,” “the Great Spirit.” Each phrase highlights a different facet of the same eternal reality.

Even the classification of spirits is symbolic. Spirits form a continuous, unbroken chain of development from the lowest to the highest. Any division—three classes, five, ten, twenty—is simply a way of mapping something that ultimately resists precise boundaries. Human sciences work the same way: different systems, different groupings, but the underlying reality remains unchanged.

Linnaeus, Jussieu, Tournefort—different classifications, yet all describe botany. The structure differs, but the science is the same.

So let us not cling too tightly to labels or categories, mistaking the container for the truth. If we look closely, we often discover that what first seemed contradictory is simply a different doorway into the same room. As we grow in understanding, the apparent differences soften, and the deeper unity becomes clear.
