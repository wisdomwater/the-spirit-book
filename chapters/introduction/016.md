Two final objections deserve attention, because unlike the rest, they come from thoughtful minds. Both agree that the physical and mental phenomena are real, but they question whether spirits are truly involved.

The first theory claims that everything attributed to spirits is simply an effect of *magnetism*—that mediums slip into a kind of waking trance in which their intuitive capacities expand far beyond normal limits. In this heightened state, they supposedly draw all their insights from themselves, even when speaking on subjects entirely unfamiliar to them in ordinary life.

Those who support this view are right about one thing: this altered state of consciousness is real, and it can be remarkable. But those who have observed spirit communication carefully and over many years know that there are countless cases in which the medium clearly acts only as an instrument. The knowledge, tone, wisdom, and even the handwriting come from somewhere beyond their own mind.

To adherents of this theory, the simple question must be asked:
*If mediums possess such extraordinary lucidity, why do they consistently claim that the wisdom they relay is not their own?*
If their awareness were as clear and self-sustaining as suggested, why would they invent intelligences beyond themselves? And how could one medium, in the same sitting, produce messages in different languages, or express ideas entirely contradictory to their own beliefs?

These variations point toward a diversity of sources—sources that cannot all be located in the mind of the medium.

The second theory suggests something slightly different: that mediums do not draw from their own thoughts, but from the thoughts of everyone around them. In this view, the medium becomes a kind of psychic mirror, reflecting what others know or subconsciously believe. And when this explanation seems insufficient, the theory broadens even further: perhaps the medium is reflecting thoughts from across the world, or even from other realms.

There is a sliver of truth here. Spiritists themselves acknowledge that the moral and emotional atmosphere of a group influences the quality of communications. But this influence is subtle—not a wholesale explanation. And it cannot account for the countless messages that arise spontaneously, containing ideas foreign to everyone present, or even opposing the beliefs of the entire group.

No matter how imaginative one becomes, the idea that a medium is absorbing the thoughts of the entire planet—or other worlds—is no simpler or more reasonable than the idea that spirits exist.

What makes these theories even more fragile is this:
The Spiritist Doctrine did not begin as a human hypothesis. It was not the invention of a single mind or a small sect of thinkers. It emerged simultaneously through countless mediums in different nations—people who had never met, who spoke different languages, who lived in different cultures, and yet relayed the same teachings.

And long before written or spoken messages appeared, the earliest communications came through simple raps that formed words letter by letter. No one had imagined this. The intelligence behind the raps declared itself to be a spirit long before anyone around the table expected such a claim.

If these ideas came from the mediums themselves, why did none of them take credit?
Why did they all agree on the same message?
Why did the message appear in places where no prior influence existed?

There is another question worth asking:
If communications truly come from the thoughts of the participants, why do the messages often refuse to answer simple questions—questions everyone in the room could easily answer? If mediums were merely reflecting human minds, nothing would be easier than revealing someone's age, or describing what they hold in their hand, or recounting events of the previous day.

Yet the higher spirits consistently decline such trivial interrogations. Their silence is not evidence of ignorance. It is evidence of dignity. Wisdom does not respond to idle curiosity any more than a seasoned teacher indulges a frivolous challenge from a student.

Finally, if mediums only reflect the minds around them, why do spirits appear and vanish at their own discretion? Why can no amount of pleading bring back a spirit once it has withdrawn? Why do messages stop abruptly, even when the desire for communication is strong on both sides?

These are the fingerprints of a will beyond our own—a presence with its own reasons, its own rhythms, its own freedom.

The more carefully and patiently one observes, the more these theories collapse under the weight of the actual evidence. Spirit communication may invite wonder, skepticism, or awe, but it cannot be explained away by explanations that ignore the full breadth of what occurs.

For those willing to watch with humility and perseverance, the truth reveals itself—not in theory, but in experience.
