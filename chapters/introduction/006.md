## VI

The beings who communicate with us identify themselves as spirits. Many say they once lived as human beings and now belong to the unseen world, just as we belong to the visible one. What follows is a simple, contemplative summary of the teachings they offer—a way to prepare our hearts before we approach the rest of this work.

**God**
God is eternal, unchanging, without physical form, perfectly just, and overflowing with goodness.
From God comes all things—every form of life, every material and immaterial reality.

**Two Worlds**
There are two intertwined realms:

* the visible, physical world, and
* the invisible world of spirits.

The spirit world is the deeper, enduring reality—the ancient root from which everything else grows. The physical world is a temporary expression, a passing envelope around something far greater.

**Spirit and Body**
Spirits sometimes take on material bodies for a time. Death simply releases them again into freedom. Among all living forms, the human body is the one chosen for spirits who have reached a certain stage of development—because it allows for moral growth, understanding, and choice.

What we call the *soul* is a spirit living in a physical body.
A human being is composed of three things:

1. the body, animated by the same life-force as animals,
2. the soul, which is the spirit itself, and
3. the subtle link between the two, a semi-material bridge called the *perispirit*.

When we die, the physical body falls away, but the spirit retains its finer, ethereal form. In certain conditions, this form can even become visible or perceptible, which explains the phenomenon of apparitions.

**The Nature of Spirits**
Spirits are not vague, abstract energies. They are real beings—individual, recognizable, capable of being sensed. They differ greatly from one another. Some are highly developed—wise, loving, luminous, and close to God. These are the pure spirits, the ones tradition has called angels. Others are less evolved, shaped still by the darker passions of human life: jealousy, pride, hatred, and fear. Some are not wicked but merely foolish, mischievous, or shallow.

Spirits do not remain in the same state forever. All grow. All learn. All advance.
Incarnation—living in a body—is one of the ways this growth occurs.
Sometimes incarnation is a mission. Sometimes it is a form of reparation.
Always it is a chance to learn, refine, and become more whole.

**Reincarnation**
When a spirit leaves its body, it returns to the invisible world for a time. After rest, reflection, and renewal, it begins another physical life. Every one of us has lived before. Every one of us will live again until our growth is complete. These lives unfold not only on earth but in many worlds, each suited to a particular stage of development.

Spirits always reincarnate in human bodies; they do not pass backward into animal forms.
Each life represents progress, not regression, though the pace depends on our choices.

**Moral Development**
Our character reflects the spirit within us.
A kind and wise person expresses a more evolved spirit.
A cruel or selfish person reflects a spirit still early in its journey.

After death, the soul retains its individuality. It remembers its past lives and meets again those it has known—friends, family, rivals, or those it harmed. Nothing remains hidden in the spiritual world. Every intention, every action, every wound we caused or healed becomes visible.

Souls that allow themselves to be elevated by love and purity draw near to higher spirits.
Souls that cling to base desires draw near to spirits of lower order.

**Where Spirits Live**
Incarnate spirits live throughout the universe, on countless worlds.
Discarnate spirits do not dwell in a fixed location. They move through space, among us, beside us—an unseen population that is constantly active.

Spirits influence not only our inner thoughts but also the material world. Many phenomena once considered mysterious find their simplest explanation in this interaction.

**Their Influence on Us**
Good spirits whisper encouragement, strengthen our courage, and help us face the trials of life with patience and dignity.
Lower spirits try to pull us into confusion, selfishness, and vice—not out of power, but out of immaturity, envy, or malice.

Communications from spirits may be subtle—quiet inspirations in our thoughts—or direct, through writing, speech, or other physical means, usually through mediums.

**Evocation and Communication**
Spirits can appear spontaneously or in response to being called.
We may call forth anyone—famous or obscure, ancient or recently departed, friend or enemy.
They may offer insight into their condition, their thoughts about us, and the truths they are permitted to reveal.

Spirits respond according to affinity. High spirits come to serious gatherings where goodness, sincerity, and moral purpose guide the conversation. Low spirits gravitate toward frivolity, curiosity, or moral chaos. They often deceive, cause mischief, or speak in the names of revered figures.

**How to Discern Spirits**
Discernment is simple.
High spirits speak with dignity, clarity, compassion, and wisdom.
Their messages uplift, guide, and illuminate.
Lower spirits speak in trivial, coarse, contradictory, or absurd ways. They flatter, manipulate, or tease human weakness.

True spiritual communication happens only in communities with a sincere desire to grow in goodness.

**The Heart of Their Teaching**
The ethics of the higher spirits can be summed up in one teaching from Jesus:
*Do to others what you would have them do to you.*
This is the law of love expressed in its simplest form.

They teach that selfishness, pride, and sensual excess bind us to our lower nature.
They teach that spiritual freedom comes from humility, compassion, simplicity, and service.
They teach that the strong must protect the weak—and that abuse of power violates God’s law.
They teach that in the spirit world, hypocrisy is impossible; every soul is seen as it truly is.
They teach that the sorrows and joys of that world correspond to our moral condition.

And above all, they teach this:
**There are no sins beyond healing.**
Every wound can be mended.
Every soul can grow.
Through effort, desire, and the many lives granted to us, we move steadily toward the perfection for which we were created.

This is the heart of the Spiritist Doctrine as communicated by the spirits themselves.
