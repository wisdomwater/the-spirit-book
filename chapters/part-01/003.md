## **CHAPTER III — Creation**

### The Formation of Worlds

The universe is made up of countless worlds — some we can see, many we cannot. It holds all living and non-living things, every star and planet moving through space, and the subtle “fluids” or fine forms of matter that fill that space.

**37. Was the universe created, or has it existed from all eternity like God?**

The universe did not create itself. If it had existed from all eternity in the same way God has, it could not be the work of God.

Reason shows us that the universe cannot be its own cause. And since it is too ordered to be the product of mere chance, it must arise from a higher intelligence — from God.

**38. How did God create the universe?**

By the power of Divine will.

Those simple, grand words from Genesis express it well: *“God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”* Creation flows from a will that only has to say “Let it be” — and it is.

**39. Can we understand the way worlds are formed?**

We can understand it only in part. What we can grasp is this: worlds arise from the condensation of matter that was once diffused throughout space.

**40. Are comets the beginning of this condensation and the formation of new worlds?**

Yes, they can be stages in that process. But it is mistaken to attribute to them the exaggerated “influences” people sometimes fear. Like all celestial bodies, they play their role in the balance of physical forces, but they are not omens of doom.

**41. Can a fully formed world disappear and its matter be scattered again into space?**

Yes. God renews worlds just as God renews living beings. Nothing in creation is fixed forever in its present form.

**42. Can we know how long it has taken for worlds like the earth to form?**

No. Only the Creator fully knows such spans. Anyone who claims to know the precise ages and times of these beginnings is fooling themselves.

### The Formation of Living Beings

**43. When did living beings first appear on the earth?**

In the beginning, everything was in a state of chaos. The elements were mixed together without order. Over time, each found its proper place. When the earth was ready, life-forms suited to that stage of the planet began to appear.

**44. Where did these living beings come from?**

The earth already held the “prototypes” of these beings — the seeds of what they would become — waiting for the right conditions. When the forces that held these elements apart subsided, they could join and organize, forming the first patterns of life.

Just as a chrysalis or a seed waits in stillness before it opens, the potential for each species lay dormant until its time. Then, each species appeared and began to multiply.

**45. Where were these organic elements before the earth took shape?**

They existed in a subtle, “fluidic” state spread through space, among spirits or on other worlds, waiting for the earth to be ready so that they could begin a new phase of existence here.

We see a reflection of this process in the world around us. Under the right conditions, inorganic molecules arrange themselves into beautifully regular crystals. A slight change in those conditions prevents their formation.

Seeds of plants and eggs of animals can lie dormant for years, even centuries, and come to life when warmth, moisture, and environment align. Life can wait quietly for a long time, carrying its potential within.

So it is not a diminishment of God’s glory to say that living beings emerged through the unfolding of natural laws from a kind of “primordial chaos.” On the contrary, it reveals a God who rules through wise, steady, eternal laws, rather than sudden whims.

**46. Are there still creatures that come into being “spontaneously”?**

Yes, but their original pattern has always existed in a hidden state. You see this constantly. Human and animal tissues host countless invisible forms of life that emerge as soon as decay creates the right conditions. What appears to “arise out of nowhere” was already present in seed form.

**47. Was the human species also included among the organic elements of the earth?**

Yes. Humanity appeared when the earth was prepared for it. This is the meaning behind the phrase that humans were formed “from the dust of the earth”: the elements of our bodies are drawn from the same materials that make up the planet.

**48. Can we know the exact ages when humans and other life-forms first appeared on earth?**

No. Our calculations are at best attempts and approximations.

**49. If the potential for the human species was present from the beginning, why don’t humans still appear spontaneously as they did at first?**

The beginnings of things are part of God’s secret.

We can say this: once human beings were established and spread over the earth, they took into themselves the elements needed to form new bodies, and then passed these on through reproduction. The same pattern applies to all other species.

### The Peopling of the Earth: Adam

**50. Did humanity begin with one single man?**

No. The man known as Adam was not the first and only human being on earth.

**51. Can we know when Adam lived?**

Approximately at the time tradition gives him — around 4,000 years before Christ.

The person called Adam in sacred story appears to be one of the survivors of a great natural catastrophe that reshaped the earth’s surface. He became the ancestor of one particular race among many.

Nature’s laws and the evidence of history contradict the idea that all human development before Christ arose in only a few centuries from a single couple. Many see Adam as a symbolic or representative figure — an image of an early epoch rather than the literal first human.

### The Diversity of Human Races

**52. Where do the physical and moral differences between the various human races come from?**

From climate, way of life, culture, and habits. Imagine two siblings raised far apart in very different environments — over time, they might have little outward resemblance in character or outlook.

**53. Did human beings first appear in different places on the globe?**

Yes, and at different times. This is one of the reasons for the diversity among races. As people spread into various climates and environments, and as different groups intermarried, many types and subtypes emerged.

> *Do these different races represent different human species?*

No. They all belong to the same human family, just as different varieties of the same fruit still belong to one species.

**54. If not all humans descend from the same single ancestor, might they stop seeing each other as brothers and sisters?**

All humans are brothers and sisters in God. They are animated by the same spiritual nature and journey toward the same ultimate goal.

If we cling too literally to words, we miss the deeper truth: unity is rooted not in a single earthly ancestor but in the One Divine Source.

### The Plurality of Worlds

**55. Are all the worlds moving through space inhabited?**

Yes. And contrary to what many on earth imagine, your world is far from being the most advanced in wisdom, goodness, or perfection.

Yet some people believe they alone possess the full truth and that this small planet is uniquely favored. Pride and vanity feed such illusions — as if the vast universe were created solely for earth’s inhabitants.

God has filled the worlds with life, each creation moving toward its own growth in harmony with Divine purpose. To suppose that life is confined to one tiny sphere is to underestimate both God’s wisdom and the greatness of creation.

**56. Do all these worlds share the same physical composition?**

No. Their structures and materials can differ widely.

**57. If their physical composition differs, are the beings that inhabit them organized differently as well?**

Yes. Just as on earth fish are suited to water and birds to air, beings elsewhere are shaped for their own environments and conditions.

**58. Do the worlds farthest from the sun lack light and heat, since the sun would be only a distant star to them?**

The sun is not the only source of light and warmth.

Consider electricity: on some worlds it plays a role far more significant than it does on earth. Also, not all beings are made of the same materials or possess the same senses and organs as humans. On certain planets, resources and forces unknown to you provide what their inhabitants need.

Just as fish can live in water in ways we might once have found unimaginable, life on other worlds adapts to conditions we can hardly picture. Some worlds may hold within themselves the sources of light and warmth that sustain their own forms of life.

### Biblical Considerations and the Account of Creation

**59. Humanity’s ideas about creation have differed widely over time, often reflecting each culture’s level of understanding.**

As knowledge has expanded, some earlier explanations have become difficult to accept. The teachings received from the Spirits support views that many thoughtful people have long held: that creation unfolded through orderly processes and immense time spans.

At first glance, this may seem to contradict the sacred texts. Yet a careful reading shows that the conflict is more apparent than real. Much depends on whether we read symbolic language as literal history.

The idea that Adam was the only ancestor of all humanity is not the first religious notion that has needed adjustment. Once, even saying that the earth revolves around the sun was condemned as opposed to Scripture. But the earth kept moving, and now no one questions that fact without denying obvious reality.

The Bible speaks of the world created in six days and gives creation a date about four thousand years before Christ, as if the earth did not exist before that and arose out of nothing. This language is solemn and powerful, yet physical science has revealed a longer and more complex story written in rocks and fossils.

We now understand the “six days” as vast periods, perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years each. This is not merely opinion; it rests on strong evidence. To insist on a strictly literal reading of such passages is to fall into the same trap that once denied the earth’s motion.

This does not mean the Bible is in error. Rather, it means we err when we force symbolic, poetic language into the mold of scientific description.

Science has also traced the order in which living beings appeared on earth — and this order harmonizes, in essence, with the sequence presented in Genesis. The difference is that instead of instantaneous creation, life emerges gradually, through natural laws set in motion by God.

Does this make God less powerful? Not at all. It reveals a God whose power is so great that it works through enduring, elegant laws, without haste and without contradiction.

On the question of the flood and Adam, science suggests that major geological cataclysms occurred long before human beings, and that human existence may be far older than a simple reading of the Biblical timeline suggests. Historical records from Egypt, India, and other cultures point to flourishing civilizations that would be difficult to compress into the short span that a literal reading would require.

Diversity among human races likewise challenges the idea that all physical types developed from a single family in a few centuries. Climate and lifestyle shape us, but they do not explain all deep structural differences. The crossing of races blends features; it does not suddenly create extreme ones.

Much becomes more coherent if we accept that:

* Human beings likely existed before the time usually assigned to Adam.
* Humanity’s origins are diverse and spread across different regions.
* Adam may have been the ancestor of one particular group, not the first human of all.
* “Noah’s flood” may have been a regional catastrophe, not the single global event that shaped all geological layers.
* Biblical language is often symbolic, poetic, and rooted in an ancient Oriental style that uses images, not scientific categories.

In time, many doctrines once harshly opposed are later reconciled with faith. Spiritual truth does not fear honest inquiry. Religion does not shrink when it walks alongside science; it becomes more luminous.

When faith and reason travel together, we are less vulnerable to disbelief and more open to a vision of God that is both majestic and deeply trustworthy.
