## **CHAPTER IV — The Vital Principle**

### Organic and Inorganic Beings

Organic beings are those that carry an inner spring of activity — a life-force moving from within. They are born, grow, reproduce, and eventually die. They possess organs suited to their needs and to the work of survival. These include humans, animals, and plants.

Inorganic beings do not have this inner vitality. They do not move on their own. They are formed by the gathering of matter into structures: stones, metals, water, air, and so on.

**60. Does the same force bind the elements of both organic and inorganic bodies?**

Yes. Both are held together by the law of attraction. This law operates everywhere, in all things.

**61. Is there a difference between the matter in organic and inorganic bodies?**

It is the same underlying matter, but in organic beings it is “animalized” — shaped and animated by life.

**62. What causes this “animalization” of matter?**

Its union with the vital principle — the life-force.

**63. Does this vital principle dwell in a distinct agent, or is it simply a property of organized matter? Is it cause or effect?**

It is both. Life is the result of this agent acting upon matter. Without matter, the agent is not “life” as you know it, and matter without this agent is not alive. Life appears where the two meet and interact. Living beings receive this principle, absorb it, and make it their own.

**64. We have seen that spirit and matter are two great elements of the universe. Does the vital principle form a third?**

It is indeed one of the necessary elements to the universe, but it springs from modifications of the one universal substance.

You can think of it as an “element,” much like oxygen or hydrogen, though even those are not truly primitive; they, too, arise from something deeper.

**65. Does the vital principle reside in any substance we already know?**

Its source is the universal fluid — what you sometimes call the magnetic or vital fluid. It is an intermediary, a bridge between spirit and matter.

**66. Is the vital principle the same for all living beings?**

Yes, the same in essence, though it is adapted and expressed differently in each species. It is this principle that enables all species to move and act. It distinguishes them from inert matter, which is moved from outside and does not generate movement from within.

**67. Is vitality a permanent quality of this vital agent, or does it only unfold when it is united to a body?**

It comes into active expression only when it is joined to a body. Without this union, the agent is not “life” in the ordinary sense.

— *So can we say that vitality is latent whenever the vital agent is not united with a body?*

Yes. It rests in potential until the right conditions call it forth.

We might think of the organs as a complex mechanism, and the vital principle as the inner power that drives it. The organs act and respond; their activity keeps this life-force circulating, much like friction kindles and sustains heat.

### Life and Death

**68. What causes the death of organic beings?**

Their organs wear out or are damaged beyond repair.

— *Is death similar to a machine stopping when its parts break down?*

Yes. If a machine is poorly built or damaged, it ceases to work. Likewise, when the body becomes too weakened or diseased, the flow of life is interrupted, and life withdraws.

**69. Why does a lesion of the heart so often cause death?**

Because the heart plays a central role in sustaining life. However, it is not the only organ whose serious damage can bring death; it is one of several essential parts.

**70. What becomes of the matter and the vital principle after death?**

The matter decomposes and is reused in the formation of other beings. The vital principle returns to the great common reservoir, the universal vital mass.

After the body dies, the elements that formed it are released and recombined into new forms. These new beings, in turn, draw upon the universal source of life, absorb it, use it, and then return it again when their time is finished.

The organs are suffused with the vital fluid. This allows different parts of the body to communicate and support each other, sometimes recovering from damage and restoring functions that had seemed lost. But when essential structures are too severely altered or destroyed, the vital fluid can no longer move effectively through them, and the organism dies.

We might compare this to an electronic device. It can receive and store energy, but nothing appears to happen until that energy is set in motion. Then we see light, sound, or movement, and we say the device is “on.” When the flow stops, the phenomena vanish and the device returns to inactivity.

In a similar way, the body holds the vital fluid, and when this fluid is in motion we call it life. When its activity ceases, we call it death.

The amount of vital fluid is not the same in every being. It varies across species and even from individual to individual. Some seem filled with abundant energy; others have only a small reserve. This vitality must be renewed — through food, breath, rest, and other means — or it becomes depleted. It can also be shared: those who have more of it can, in some circumstances, help strengthen those who have less, sometimes even drawing someone back from the brink of death.

### Intelligence and Instinct

**71. Is intelligence a property of the vital principle?**

No. Plants are alive but they do not think. They have organic life, but not reflective thought.

Intelligence and matter are distinct. A body can be alive and yet lack intelligence. Intelligence, however, needs some form of organized matter in order to show itself. It is only when animalized matter is united with spirit that conscious intelligence appears.

We can distinguish:

1. **Inanimate beings** — made of matter only; no life, no intelligence (minerals, for example).
2. **Animate, non-thinking beings** — made of matter and endowed with vitality, but not with conscious intelligence (plants).
3. **Animate, thinking beings** — made of matter, endowed with vitality, and animated by an intelligent principle (animals and humans, to varying degrees).

**72. What is the source of intelligence?**

It springs from the universal intelligence.

— *Can we say that every intelligent being draws and assimilates a portion of this universal intelligence, just as it draws life from the universal vital principle?*

This comparison is helpful but not exact. Intelligence is a faculty proper to each being. It forms part of what makes each mind unique.

There are aspects of this mystery that humans are not yet ready to fully grasp, and this is one of them — for now.

**73. Is instinct different from intelligence?**

Not entirely. Instinct is a kind of intelligence — an unreasoning, immediate intelligence by which beings are guided to meet their needs and preserve their lives.

**74. Can we clearly draw a line between instinct and intelligence — where one ends and the other begins?**

No, not precisely. They often blend into each other. But we can usually recognize which actions are purely instinctive and which involve reflection, choice, or deliberate thought.

**75. Is it true that instinct diminishes as intelligence develops?**

No. Instinct remains, but humans tend to ignore or overwrite it.

Instinct can guide us toward what is good; it often protects us more surely than our reason. Instinct does not err. Reason, however, is easily distorted by pride, selfishness, fear, and poor formation. Instinct does not argue or justify; reason does — and with reason comes freedom to choose, and therefore the possibility of going astray.

Instinct is a simple, foundational form of intelligence. It acts spontaneously and directly. Intelligence, in the fuller sense, involves reflection and conscious choice. In beings who have awareness and perception, instinct joins with intelligence, will, and freedom — and together they shape the journey of the soul.
