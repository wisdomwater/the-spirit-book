## **CHAPTER I — GOD**

### **God and the Infinite**

**1. What is God?**

God is the highest wisdom and the originating source behind all things — the primal spark from which everything arises.

**2. What is meant by the Infinite?**

The Infinite is that which has no beginning and no end — the great unknown beyond our understanding. Whatever lies beyond our comprehension feels infinite to us.

**3. Can we say that God *is* the Infinite?**

Not exactly. Our language is too small to capture what God truly is. God *contains* the infinite through perfect love, perfect wisdom, and perfect being, but “the Infinite” is only one dim glimpse of the Divine, not a full picture. Trying to define the most mysterious Reality by another mystery only shows the limits of our words.

### **Proofs of the Existence of God**

**4. Where can we find proof of God’s existence?**

In the simplest principle your mind already trusts: every effect has a cause.
Look at anything not crafted by human hands — the stars, the breath of living creatures, the rhythms of nature — and reason whispers back, “This, too, has a Source.”

**5. If all people carry an inner sense of God’s existence, what does this tell us?**

That this inner knowing points toward something real. An intuition shared across all cultures and ages must arise from more than imagination; it is a deep echo of its own Cause.

**6. Could this inner sense simply come from education or culture?**

If that were so, the earliest peoples — who had no teachers — would not have felt it. Yet they did. A truth that appears everywhere and always cannot be merely taught; it is remembered.

**7. Could the first cause of all things be found in the properties of matter itself?**

Even if matter has properties, something must have given rise to those properties. Whatever begins must come from something deeper.

**8. What about the idea that everything arose from chance?**

Chance has no intention, no wisdom, no direction. The harmony of the universe — its beauty, order, and inner coherence — speaks of an intelligent Presence. An “intelligent chance” would not be chance at all.

**9. How do we recognize a Supreme Intelligence in this first cause?**

By the very same wisdom used in daily life: you know the artist by the artwork.
When you look honestly at creation, you see a skill and beauty beyond human capacity. And where there is such work, there must be a Worker — greater than us, and yet intimately near.

### **The Attributes of the Divine**

**10. Can we comprehend God’s deepest nature?**

No. Our minds are not yet expansive enough to hold such fullness.

**11. Will we ever be able to?**

Yes. As the soul grows freer from the heaviness of matter and learns to love with greater purity, we draw nearer to God. With greater nearness comes greater clarity.

**12. Even so, can we glimpse some of God’s qualities now?**

We can. Our understanding is partial, but through reflection, intuition, and the quiet movement of the heart, we sense touches of God’s perfection.

**13. When we say God is eternal, infinite, unchanging, immaterial, one, all-powerful, perfectly just and perfectly good — does this not describe God fully?**

For us, these words are the best we have. Yet they are still incomplete.

Human vocabulary cannot express realities that transcend experience. Still, reason assures us that God must hold these qualities in their highest form — for anything less would no longer be God.

God is **eternal**: if God had a beginning, God would be caused by something else.

God is **unchanging**: if God changed, the universe could not rest on stable laws.

God is **immaterial**: anything bound to matter changes; God does not.

God is **one**: if there were many gods, the universe would lack unity and coherence.

God is **all-powerful**: nothing exists outside God’s sustaining presence.

God is **just and good**: wisdom and compassion shine even in the smallest details of creation.

### **Pantheism**

**14. Is God a distinct Being, or simply the combined sum of all forces in the universe?**

If God were only the sum of created things, then God would not be the origin — merely a result. God would be an effect rather than a cause, which contradicts the very idea of God.

Seeking anything beyond this leads us into confusion. What matters most is not unraveling Divine mystery but learning to become more loving, more honest, and more whole.

**15. What of the belief that everything in the universe is itself a piece of God?**

It is often a way for humans, unable to rise to God, to bring God down to themselves.

**16. Advocates of pantheism say that because everything exists, God must be everything — infinite, everywhere, and diffused through nature. How do we respond?**

By using gentle reason. If God were identical with matter, then God would change whenever matter changes. God would lose the very qualities — stability, immutability, transcendence — that define the Divine.

Matter can reflect God, reveal God, and carry traces of God’s beauty — just as art reveals the artist — but the painting is not the painter.

God’s presence is known through creation, but God is more than creation.
God is the Source from which all things arise and toward which all things return, the living intelligence behind every breath, every star, every unfolding moment.
