## **CHAPTER II — The General Elements of the Universe**

### **The Knowledge of the Origin of Things**

**17. Can human beings know the origin of all things?**

Not fully. In this life, certain mysteries remain veiled. God allows enough light for our growth, but not so much that every secret is laid bare.

**18. Will we someday understand what is now hidden from us?**

Yes — gradually. As the soul becomes clearer, gentler, and more attuned to the Divine, more of reality becomes visible. But true comprehension requires capacities we are still developing.

**19. Can we uncover some of nature’s secrets through science?**

Science is one of God’s gifts for human progress. Yet it, too, has boundaries. Beyond a certain point, mystery remains mystery.

Our thirst for understanding is good, but pride often leads us astray. We build theories atop theories, only to watch them crumble with new discoveries. What we thought was truth sometimes dissolves into error, and what we dismissed becomes meaningful. In this humbling, we learn reverence.

**20. Apart from scientific investigation, can higher truths be revealed to us?**

Yes. When it serves our growth, God may reveal what can’t be discovered by the senses alone.

Through such revelations we catch glimpses of where we have come from and where we are headed.

### **Spirit and Matter**

**21. Is matter eternal like God, or did it begin at some point?**

Only God knows. But consider this: the One who is perfect goodness and perfect love has never been inactive. However far back you imagine the story of creation, God’s life and movement reach farther still.

**22. We often define matter as something extended, tangible, and solid. Are these definitions correct?**

They are correct only from the standpoint of your senses. Matter can also exist in forms so delicate and so subtle that you cannot perceive them — yet they remain matter.

> *Then how should we understand matter?*

Matter is what allows spirit to act within creation. It is the field, the instrument, the medium through which spirit expresses itself and learns.

**23. What is spirit?**

Spirit is the intelligent principle woven through the universe — the living essence behind thought, will, and consciousness.

> *But what is spirit made of?*

Your language struggles here. To your senses, spirit seems like “nothing,” yet it is far from nothing. “Nothing” does not exist.

**24. Is spirit the same thing as intelligence?**

Intelligence is one of spirit’s essential qualities. From your perspective they seem inseparable, and that understanding is close enough.

**25. Is spirit independent of matter, or is it a property of matter?**

Spirit and matter are distinct. Yet their union is necessary for matter to act with intelligence.

> *Is that union also necessary for spirit to express itself?*

For you, yes. Your senses can only perceive spirit when it operates through some form of matter.

**26. Can we conceive of spirit apart from matter, and matter apart from spirit?**

Yes — through thought. Your mind can separate what your senses cannot.

**27. Then does the universe contain two primary elements: matter and spirit?**

Yes — and above all stands God, the Source of both. Together, these form a kind of universal trinity.

Between spirit and dense matter lies the **universal fluid** — a subtle and foundational substance, more refined than matter yet still belonging to the material realm. This fluid allows spirit to influence matter without being bound by its heaviness. Under spirit’s direction, it combines and recombines into forms you know little about. Without it, matter would remain scattered and inert, unable to gather or organize.

> *Is this universal fluid the same as electricity?*

Electricity and magnetism are variations of this deeper fluid. They are transformations of a single, primordial substance.

**28. Wouldn’t it be clearer to speak of “inert matter” and “intelligent matter”?**

Use whatever language helps you understand one another. Many disagreements arise simply because people attach different meanings to the same words. Human language struggles to express realities beyond the senses.

What we *do* know is this: matter can be observed, and intelligence can be recognized — and they are not the same. Their origin and connection remain mysterious, but above both we perceive a greater Intelligence guiding all things. This we call God.

### **The Properties of Matter**

**29. Is weight an essential property of matter?**

Of matter as you know it, yes. But the universal fluid — subtle and refined — is weightless to you, even though it is the root of all tangible matter.

Weight itself is relative. Outside a world’s gravity, there is no “heavy” or “light.”

**30. Is matter made of one element or many?**

There is one primal element. What you call “simple bodies” are actually transformations of this original substance.

**31. Where do matter’s different properties come from?**

From the ways its most basic particles combine under various conditions.

**32. So flavors, colors, sounds, and even healing or poisonous effects are all modifications of one substance?**

Yes — and they exist only through the organs meant to perceive them.

This is why people do not experience the world in the same way: one tastes sweetness where another tastes bitterness; one sees blue where another sees red; what harms one may heal another.

**33. Can the same basic substance take on all possible forms and properties?**

It can. This is part of the meaning behind the phrase, “everything is in everything.”

The elements you call oxygen, carbon, nitrogen — all are variations of the same underlying essence. For now, they function as separate elements in your science, and that is sufficient.

> *Does this support the view that matter has only two essential qualities — force and movement — and everything else is secondary?*

Yes, as long as you add that the arrangement of particles also matters. An object may be opaque or transparent depending on how its particles are positioned.

**34. Do these particles have a definite form?**

They do, though you cannot yet perceive it.

> *Is this form constant?*

The most primitive particles have a constant form. Once they begin combining, the forms vary endlessly.

### **Universal Space**

**35. Is universal space infinite or limited?**

Infinite. If it had an edge, you would still have to ask, “What lies beyond?” Your mind cannot grasp infinity, yet your reason quietly tells you it must be so.

Even imagining a boundary does not resolve the mystery — for beyond that boundary, something would still exist, even if only empty space.

**36. Does a true void exist anywhere in the universe?**

No. What appears empty to you is filled with forms of matter too subtle for your senses to detect.
