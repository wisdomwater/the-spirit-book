## Chapter I — Earthly Joys and Sorrows

### Relative Happiness and Unhappiness

**920. Can people enjoy complete happiness while on earth?**

Not complete happiness—not in the absolute sense. Earthly life is given as a *trial* or an *expiation* (a place where we learn, heal, and make amends). Still, we are not left helpless. We can soften much of what hurts us, and we can learn to be as happy as life on this dense plane reasonably allows.

**921. If full happiness will come when humanity is transformed, can anyone experience *relative* happiness now?**

Yes. And often the surprising truth is that we forge much of our own unhappiness.

When we practice God’s law—especially love, justice, and charity—we spare ourselves many unnecessary sufferings. Then we discover a kind of happiness that fits this world: not perfect bliss, but real peace.

Those who understand their future destiny begin to see bodily life as a brief journey—like a short stop at a difficult inn. And because the destination is brighter, the bumps along the road don’t feel like the whole story.

Many of the “misfortunes” we grieve are the downstream consequences of small deviations: a turn off the straight path, a habit indulged, an excess repeated—until we wake up far from where we meant to be.

**922. Is there a common standard of happiness for everyone?**

For material life: having what is *necessary*.

For moral life: a clear conscience and faith in the future.

**923. But doesn’t “necessary” change with social position?**

Yes—at least according to the materialistic assumptions, ambitions, and social illusions we often carry.

Someone who once had far more money may feel “deprived” when their lifestyle must shrink. But consider this gently and honestly: how can we call *that* “lacking necessities” when others are truly freezing, hungry, and without shelter?

To be happy, the wise look *down*—not in contempt, but in perspective. They stop measuring life by what’s above them. And when they lift their gaze, it is to lift the soul toward the Infinite. (See no. 715)

**924. What about misfortunes that are not caused by our choices and that strike even the righteous? Can we avoid them?**

If you want to grow, you must learn to endure certain trials without bitterness.

But you are not asked to endure them without consolation. A good conscience gives a quiet strength. Faith in the future gives hope. And hope steadies the heart—especially when you are doing what is needed to become worthy of that future.

**925. Why does God allow some people to have wealth who do not seem to deserve it?**

It looks like a favor only to those who see no farther than the present.

Wealth is not always a reward. Often it is a dangerous test—frequently more dangerous than poverty. (See nos. 814 ff.)

**926. Since civilization creates new needs, isn’t it also the source of new afflictions?**

Often, yes—because many sufferings come from *artificial desires* we create and then treat as necessities.

Those who learn to limit their wants—who can look without greed at what is beyond their means—avoid countless disappointments. In a deep sense, the wealthiest people are those who need the least.

And don’t envy those who look fortunate. You don’t know what waits behind their curtains. If they use wealth only for themselves, their selfishness will eventually bring reversals. Pity them instead. Sometimes the wicked prosper for a time, but their prosperity is not meant to be admired—it will often be paid for in tears.

And if the righteous suffer, it is often a trial that becomes credit to them when borne with courage. Remember Jesus’ words: *Blessed are those who suffer, for they shall be comforted.*

**927. But surely lacking necessities is real misfortune. Isn’t it?**

Yes. When someone truly lacks what is necessary for life and bodily health, that is real suffering.

Sometimes deprivation comes from one’s own choices; sometimes it is the wrongdoing of others. In that case, the moral weight falls on the one who caused it.

**928. Don’t many misfortunes come from ignoring our true vocation—our natural aptitudes?**

Yes. And often parents contribute to this through pride or greed, pushing children away from their natural path—and damaging their happiness. They will have to answer for that.

* *Would it be right for a child of the upper classes to become a cobbler if that were his aptitude?*

You needn’t force extreme examples. Civilization has many kinds of useful work. The deeper point is this: people thrive when their gifts are matched to their work. Misery often comes from trying to live outside one’s true capacity—like insisting on a role that doesn’t fit, then suffering the collapse.

And pride makes it worse: it keeps people from humble work, and it tempts them to see suicide as an “exit” from embarrassment. A moral education that healed pride would prevent much destitution.

**929. If someone has no resources even though abundance exists around them—and they see only death as an answer—what should they do?**

They should never accept starvation as inevitable.

There is almost always some honest work available—if pride does not block the path between need and labor. There are no dishonorable professions. What is dishonorable is not work itself, but the contempt that refuses it.

**930. But what about those who are willing to work and still cannot—because of illness or causes outside their control?**

In a society truly shaped by Christ’s law, no one should die of hunger.

With wise, provident social organization, people would not lack necessities except by their own fault—and even that “fault” is often the product of environment and neglect. When God’s law is practiced, society becomes grounded in justice and solidarity, and people become better, too. (See no. 793)

**931. Why are the suffering classes more numerous than the fortunate?**

No one is perfectly happy. Many who seem fortunate carry hidden griefs. Suffering is everywhere.

But also: Earth is a place of expiation. When humanity transforms it into a home for goodness and good spirits, unhappiness will fade. Then this world will feel like a terrestrial paradise.

**932. Why do the wicked often seem to have more influence than the good?**

Because the good are often not assertive. The wicked scheme and dare; the good hesitate.

But when the good truly choose to act with courage and unity, they will prevail.

**933. If people create much of their material suffering, do they create even more of their mental suffering?**

Even more.

Material pain can sometimes arrive uninvited. But inner torments—wounded pride, frustrated ambition, anxious greed, envy, jealousy—these passions become the soul’s private furnace.

Envy and jealousy are like voracious worms. Where they live, calm and rest cannot. They haunt a person’s waking and sleeping. With such passions, people build their own punishments—and Earth becomes a hell inside them.

Many phrases say this truth plainly: “puffed up with pride,” “bursting with jealousy,” “dying of envy.” They are not just metaphors—they are diagnoses.

Often we suffer because we attach outsized importance to the temporary. Vanity, ambition, and greed shrink the horizon until life feels like a cramped room. But when we lift our thoughts toward the Infinite—our true destiny—so many “catastrophes” become what they are: passing losses, like a child grieving a broken toy.

Some find happiness only in gratifying pride and appetite, so they become miserable when gratification is denied. Others, who are simple and moderate, can be content with what others would call misfortune.

Civilized life can make this worse because we analyze and magnify our sorrows. Yet the same capacity to reflect can also become a doorway into consolation—through Christian hope, and through the certainty of the future life.

### The Loss of Loved Ones

**934. Isn’t the loss of loved ones a legitimate and irreparable sorrow, independent of our will?**

Yes. It strikes rich and poor alike. It is a law of life in this world—often a trial or expiation.

But there is comfort: the possibility of communion—of relationship continuing beyond the grave—through the means available to you now, while awaiting ways that will one day feel even more direct.

**935. What about those who say communicating with the departed is a sacrilege?**

There is no sacrilege where there is reverence.

When it is done with respect and sincerity, spirits who love you are glad to come near. They rejoice in being remembered and in being able to converse. The only true irreverence would be frivolity—treating the sacred as entertainment.

The continued relationship with those who have passed is a tender consolation. It softens separation. It assures us they are not lost, and it anchors our hope that reunion is real.

**936. How does inconsolable grief affect the spirit who is grieved?**

Spirits feel our love and our sorrow.

But persistent, unreasonable grief can weigh on them painfully, because it can signal a lack of faith in the future and trust in God—an obstacle to progress, and sometimes even a hindrance to reunion.

When a spirit is happier beyond this life, to mourn their departure as if it were pure tragedy is to grieve their freedom. It is like resenting a friend being released from prison before you.

Love does not demand shared captivity. Love learns to bless the one who is freed—and to wait with patient hope for one’s own liberation.

Spiritism (as Kardec frames it) offers a particular kind of comfort: not denial of grief, but the end of abandonment. The most isolated person is never truly alone; the heart is surrounded by unseen companions.

And when we endure life’s hardships with courage—silencing constant complaint—we later rejoice, like a long-suffering patient finally healed.

### Disappointments, Ungratefulness, Broken Affections

**937. Aren’t disappointments from ingratitude and fragile friendships a real bitterness for the human heart?**

Yes—but learn to pity the ungrateful.

Ingratitude is a child of selfishness, and selfish people eventually meet hearts as hard as their own. You are not the first to be repaid poorly for good. Remember that even Jesus was mocked and despised.

Let the good you do be its own reward here. Ingratitude tests whether you will continue doing good even when you are not applauded. That persistence will be credited to you. And those who repay love with coldness will face the moral weight of their choice.

**938. Could repeated ingratitude harden the heart and make it insensitive?**

It would be tragic if it did.

Those with a living heart remain capable of happiness because they can rejoice in the good they have done. Even if it is forgotten here, it is remembered elsewhere—and the ungrateful will one day feel remorse.

* *But even if we know this, the heart still hurts. Wouldn’t it be easier to be less sensitive?*

Easier, perhaps—but it would be a selfish happiness, and a sad one.

If you recognize that those who abandoned you were unworthy of your friendship, the loss becomes lighter. And in time you will find hearts more aligned with yours. Pity those who mistreat you—they will suffer a painful recompense. Don’t let their smallness shrink you. Let it lift you above them.

Nature gave us the need to love and be loved. The meeting of attuned hearts is one of Earth’s sweetest joys—a preview of a world where love and benevolence reign, a joy the selfish cannot taste.

### Antipathetic Unions

**939. If sympathetic spirits are drawn together, why is love so often one-sided, or affection received with indifference—even repulsion? Why do some loves turn into dislike or hatred?**

Sometimes it is a passing punishment or a temporary trial.

And often, people confuse bodily attraction with soul-affinity. Many believe they love deeply because they are captivated by appearance or passion—until shared life reveals the truth. Living together is the real mirror.

Yet the reverse also happens: unions that seem incompatible at first can, over time, become tender and enduring as mutual esteem grows.

Remember: it is the spirit that loves, not the body. When physical illusion fades, the spirit sees what is real.

There are two kinds of affection:

* affection of the body (often intense, often perishable),
* affection of the soul (quiet, pure, lasting).

When these are confused, people who once spoke of “eternal love” may later feel only bitterness—because what they called love was largely illusion.

**940. Isn’t lack of sympathy between people forced to live together a bitter suffering that poisons life?**

Yes—very bitter.

But often humans are the main cause. Laws and social structures sometimes trap people. And many unions are formed not for mutual affection but for pride, status, ambition, or convenience. Then suffering follows as consequence.

* *Isn’t there often an innocent victim?*

Yes. For that one, it can be a heavy expiation. But responsibility falls on the one who caused the misery. And when truth reaches the victim, faith in the future offers consolation.

As prejudices weaken, such private miseries will become less common.

### The Fear of Death

**941. Why do so many fear death if they have an entire future ahead?**

Because they have been taught distorted images: heaven and hell as crude absolutes, nature treated as sin, and salvation turned into terror. Some then reject these fears and fall into atheism or materialism—believing nothing exists beyond this life. Others keep the fearful belief and tremble at endless punishment.

But death does not terrify the righteous. Faith gives them certainty, hope points them toward a better life, and charity leaves them with the quiet assurance that they will not enter the next world ashamed to meet any gaze. (See no. 730)

Those who live only for bodily pleasures cling to this life because it is the only one they trust. Their desires keep them anxious; their doubts keep them afraid.

But moral persons—who rise above artificial needs—taste a serenity unknown to the purely material. Moderated desire brings calm. Good deeds give joy. And disappointments pass over the soul more lightly.

**942. Won’t some people call these teachings “banal”—as if the secret of happiness is just “endure misfortune”?**

Yes, many will say that. But many are like sick patients who want healing without the medicine, and relief without the discipline. They want the fruit without the cultivation.

### Dissatisfaction with Life, Suicide

**943. Where does dissatisfaction with life come from when there seems to be no clear reason?**

Often: idleness, lack of faith, and satiety.

When someone uses their faculties in useful work aligned with their natural aptitudes, labor is not empty. Life moves with purpose. They endure trials with more patience because their hope reaches toward a deeper happiness ahead.

**944. Do people have the right to take their own life?**

No. That right belongs to God alone. Intentional suicide violates this law.

* *Is suicide always intentional?*

Those who are truly insane do not know what they are doing.

**945. What about those who kill themselves simply because they’re dissatisfied with life?**

It is folly. Why not work? Life would feel less heavy if they engaged their gifts with purpose.

**946. What about those who commit suicide to escape troubles and disappointments?**

Poor spirits—lacking courage to bear life’s trials.

God helps those who suffer, not those who refuse to struggle. Trials are meant for growth. Blessed are those who endure without bitterness.

And those who trust “luck” or “chance” to save them misunderstand life. A brief relief may come, but only to make them feel more sharply later the emptiness of that hope.

* *Will those who drove someone to despair bear responsibility?*

Yes. They must answer for it as for a murder.

**947. What about those who do not directly kill themselves, but “give up” and die of despair?**

It is still a kind of suicide.

Those who caused it—or could have prevented it—may be guiltier than the one who collapses. Yet the one who yielded is not entirely absolved if they lacked perseverance, failed to use their intelligence to seek a path forward, or fell into despair from pride.

Pride is especially tragic here: some would rather starve than do humble work, rather die than “descend” socially. Yet there is greater dignity in struggling against adversity than in surrendering life to the opinion of a vain and selfish society.

**948. Is suicide to escape the shame of an evil act as wrong as suicide from despair?**

Yes. Suicide does not erase wrongdoing; it adds another wrong to the first.

Those who had courage to do evil should have courage to face its consequences. God judges. And depending on motive and circumstance, God may lessen punishment—but the act remains a grave mistake.

**949. Is suicide excusable if someone believes they are sparing their children or family shame?**

They do not truly do good by it, though they may *think* they do—and God considers intention. This may mitigate the fault, but it remains wrong.

And note: many such suicides are fed by unhealthy social prejudices. Heal the prejudices, and you will reduce the desperation.

**950. What about those who kill themselves hoping to reach a better life sooner?**

Another folly. Do good, and you will reach it more surely.

Suicide delays rather than hastens. Often the soul must return to complete what it cut short.

**951. Is it ever meritorious to give one’s life to save others?**

If the intention is to save and serve, it is sublime—and it is not suicide.

But God does not delight in needless sacrifice, especially if pride stains it. A sacrifice is truly meritorious only when selfless.

Still, every true sacrifice that costs personal happiness for another’s good is precious before God. And because life is the earthly treasure we cling to most, surrendering it for love is a profound act—so long as one has honestly considered whether one’s continued life might be even more useful than one’s death.

**952. Is it suicide when someone dies from the abuse of passions—habits they knew would shorten life but could no longer resist?**

It is a *moral suicide*.

They are doubly guilty: they lack courage, yield to brutishness, and forget God.

* *Are they more or less guilty than those who kill themselves from despair?*

Often more guilty, because they had time to reflect and turn back. Momentary suicide can sometimes involve a delirium bordering on madness; long habitual self-destruction usually involves prolonged consent.

**953. If someone faces an inevitable, terrible death, is it wrong to hasten it to shorten suffering?**

Yes. It is wrong not to wait for the term set by God.

And how can someone be certain their hour has come? Unexpected help can appear even at the last moment.

* *But suppose death is truly inevitable, and life is only shortened by moments?*

Even then, it reflects a lack of resignation and trust in the Creator.

* *What are the consequences?*

An expiation proportionate to the seriousness of the wrong, in light of circumstances.

**954. Is a reckless act that risks life without necessity reprehensible?**

There is no guilt when there is no intention or awareness of doing harm.

**955. What about cultures where widows have been compelled to die on their husband’s funeral pyre? Is that suicide?**

Usually, it is obedience to a brutal prejudice—often under coercion. They believe they are fulfilling duty. Their ignorance and lack of moral development lessen culpability.

Such barbarous customs fade as civilization grows.

**956. If someone kills themselves hoping to rejoin loved ones, do they succeed?**

No. The result is the opposite.

Rather than quick reunion, they distance themselves longer—because God cannot reward an act born of distrust in Providence. The momentary “escape” is paid for with heavier afflictions than those they tried to shorten. (See nos. 934 ff.)

**957. In general, what happens to the spirit after suicide?**

Consequences vary widely—there is no single fixed penalty. Everything is relative to causes and circumstances.

But one consequence is universal: disappointment.

Often, violent death abruptly breaks the bond between spirit and body while it is still strong—unlike natural death, where the bond loosens gradually. This can prolong confusion, and sometimes produces the haunting illusion of still being alive among the living. (See nos. 155, 165)

In some cases, the lingering affinity between spirit and body causes the spirit to suffer the body’s decay through a kind of repercussion—an anguished, horrifying experience. This is not universal, but it is possible.

And in all cases, suicide does not free the soul from its lesson. Sooner or later, the soul must face and repair what it tried to evade. Many spirits have said they chose new trials afterward to learn the resignation they previously lacked.

Religion, morality, and philosophy condemn suicide—but many still ask, “Why can’t I end my suffering?” The Spiritist teaching answers not only with ideas, but with the lived testimony of those who have gone that route: suicide is not merely a moral wrong—it is a reckless act that brings no true relief, and often brings the opposite.
