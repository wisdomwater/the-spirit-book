## CHAPTER II — Future Joys and Sorrows

### Nothingness. The Future Life

**958. Why are humans instinctively horrified by nothingness?**

Because nothingness doesn’t exist.

**959. Where does our instinctive sense of a future life come from?**

Because before incarnation the spirit knows the reality of spirit life, and the soul carries a faint memory of it into earthly life.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* People in every age naturally wonder about what comes after death because life is short and uncertain. The idea of “nothingness” repels reason. Even those who live carefree often become serious when death approaches. Belief in God without belief in continued life becomes incoherent, because God placed the sense of future life in the heart for a reason. And if individuality were erased, survival would be meaningless—equivalent to nothingness.

### The Intuition of Future Joys and Sorrows

**960. Why do all cultures believe in future rewards and punishments?**

Because the spirit carries an inner intuition of this reality. An inner voice tries to tell you, but people often don’t listen.

**961. At the moment of death, what do people mostly feel: doubt, fear, or hope?**

Doubt for hardened skeptics, fear for the guilty, and hope for the good.

**962. Why are there skeptics if everyone has some inner sense of spiritual truth?**

There are fewer true skeptics than you think. Many pretend out of pride, but when death comes, their bravado fades.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Justice itself suggests that good and evil do not end up in the same condition. Our built-in sense of fairness hints at consequence beyond the grave.

---

### God’s Intervention in Punishments and Rewards

**963. Is God personally concerned with each individual? Aren’t we too small?**

Yes. God cares for every created being, however small. Nothing is too insignificant for divine goodness.

**964. Must God personally track every action to punish or reward us?**

God established laws that govern actions. If you violate them, you experience the consequences. God doesn’t need to “declare a sentence” each time—breaking a law naturally produces its results.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Even “small” actions can still violate divine law. If we suffer from it, we’re often suffering the natural result of what we did. We become the craftsmen of our future happiness or unhappiness.

### The Nature of Future Joys and Sorrows

**965. Are the joys and sorrows of the soul after death material?**

No. The soul isn’t matter, so its joys and pains aren’t material. And they’re often *more intense* than earthly ones, because matter no longer dulls sensitivity.

**966. Why do humans form crude or absurd ideas about the afterlife?**

Because intelligence is still developing, and because people were taught using images and comparisons that later generations mistakenly treated as literal.

**967. What does the happiness of good spirits consist of?**

Knowing more clearly, being free from hatred, jealousy, envy, ambition, and the passions that torment humans. Being happy in doing good. Happiness matches progress: only pure spirits have perfect happiness, but there are countless degrees between the worst and the best.

**968. But isn’t satisfying material needs a source of pleasure for humans?**

Yes—humans enjoy satisfying animal needs. But when those needs can’t be met, they become torture.

**969. What does it mean that pure spirits are “in the bosom of God” and “sing praises”?**

It’s symbolic language. It points to their awareness of divine goodness and wisdom. They are not stuck in dull, endless contemplation; they are active—helping others progress—and that activity is part of their joy.

**970. What do the sufferings of low-order spirits consist of?**

They vary, but often include craving happiness without being able to reach it: regret, jealousy, rage, despair, remorse, and deep anguish.

**971. Is the influence spirits exert on each other always good?**
Good spirits influence for good. Perverse spirits try to pull others away from repentance and goodness.

> — *So death doesn’t free us from temptation?*

Not completely, but temptation is weaker for spirits than for humans because spirits aren’t fueled by bodily passions.

**972. How do evil spirits tempt other spirits if bodily passions are gone?**

Though not bodily, passions can still exist mentally for less-evolved spirits. They lure others into witnessing scenes that stimulate those old cravings.

**— But what is the point if they can’t actually participate?**

That frustration is exactly part of their torment: misers see gold but can’t possess it; the debauched see excess but can’t take part; the proud see honors but can’t obtain them.

**973. What are the greatest sufferings evil spirits endure?**

Some mental torments are hard to describe—even for the spirits suffering them. One of the most terrifying is the belief that they are condemned forever.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* As understanding grows, people stop taking images literally. Future suffering is not physical fire, but it is still real, logical, and painful—often as the consequence of what the soul has become.

---

### Eternal Fire and the “Eternity” of Punishment

**974. Where does the doctrine of eternal fire come from?**

From taking an image as literal reality.

**— But doesn’t that fear help people behave?**

Look honestly: it doesn’t even restrain many who teach it. Teach what reason later rejects, and the effect won’t last.

**975. Do low-order spirits understand the happiness of the good?**

Yes—and that understanding tortures them because they see they lost it by their own fault. This often drives them to desire reincarnation and choose trials that can repair what they did.

**976. Do good spirits suffer when they see suffering spirits?**

Not in a way that destroys their happiness. They know suffering ends, and helping others improve is part of their work and joy.

**— But what if the suffering ones are loved ones from earth?**

They aren’t disturbed by your trials the way you imagine. They see your suffering as temporary and as something that can help you grow—if you endure it with courage. They grieve more over your despair than over the pain itself.

**977. Since spirits can’t hide thoughts, do guilty spirits constantly see their victims?**

Yes—common sense says they can’t avoid that.

**— Is that constant exposure a punishment?**

Yes, and often more painful than you’d think. It lasts until expiation is complete.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* After death, the past is uncovered. The guilty cannot hide from the presence and memory of those they harmed. The righteous encounter peace and goodwill.

**978. Does the memory of past wrongs disturb a spirit even after purification?**

No—because it has atoned and emerged victorious from the trials that healed it.

**979. Do the future trials needed for full purification disturb the spirit’s happiness?**

For a still-tainted soul, yes. For a soul already well advanced, the thought of remaining trials isn’t painful.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* A soul that reaches real purity experiences a sweet satisfaction. The veil lifts; creation makes sense in a new way.

**980. Is the affinity between spirits of the same order a source of happiness?**

Yes. Their unity is a great joy because it isn’t threatened by selfishness. Their relationships are sincere—no hypocrisy, no false friends.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Humans taste this faintly when they find true spiritual friendship on earth.

**981. Is there a difference in the afterlife between those who feared death and those who welcomed it?**

Sometimes a great difference—but it depends on *why* they feared or desired death. If someone wants death only to escape trials, it can reflect complaint against Providence.

**982. Is it necessary to profess Spiritism and believe in manifestations to be well in the next life?**

No. Otherwise, countless people would be unfairly excluded. Only goodness secures future well-being. Spiritism can help by clarifying and encouraging progress, but it is not a gatekeeper to salvation.

---

### Temporary Punishments

**983. If expiation in a new life is physical suffering, is the soul’s suffering after death only mental?**

Yes: the body feels physical pain, but the spirit can suffer mentally—sometimes even more intensely. And future hardships can mirror the harm caused: the rich who abused wealth may suffer poverty; the proud may face humiliation; the harsh ruler may become the oppressed.

**984. Are the troubles of life always punishment for wrongs in the present life?**

No. Many are trials chosen before birth, or expiations for wrongs from former lives. No violation of divine law goes without consequence—if not here, then later.

**985. Is reincarnating on a less dense world a reward?**

It follows purification. As the spirit becomes purer, it inhabits better worlds, until it is fully free of moral impurity.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Less material worlds have fewer harsh needs and pains. People live more peacefully, guided by justice, love, and charity.

**986. Can spirits progress yet still reincarnate on the same world?**

Yes—if they didn’t complete a mission and ask to return to finish it. In that case it is not expiation.

**987. What happens to those who do no evil but also do nothing to overcome material influence?**

They remain stalled and must repeat similar lives. Stagnation prolongs the condition.

**988. Some people seem to live serenely with no troubles. Does that mean no expiation?**

Usually that serenity is only apparent. Some choose easy lives, but later realize they didn’t advance. Spirits grow through activity; deliberate idleness delays happiness.

**989. What about people who aren’t “wicked” but make everyone miserable through their character?**

They will expiate that: they will be confronted with the unhappiness they caused, and in another life will endure what they made others endure.

---

### Expiation and Repentance

**990. Does repentance happen in the body or in spirit life?**

In spirit life, and also in bodily life when you clearly see the difference between good and evil.

**991. What does repentance in spirit life produce?**

A desire for a new incarnation to purify, repair, and grow.

**992. What does repentance in bodily life produce?**

Real advancement *now*—if you still have time to repair what you’ve done.

**993. Are there people so inclined to evil they cannot repent?**

No. All spirits must progress. Those with an “instinct for evil” now will have an “instinct for good” later, through many lives if needed.

**994. Do wicked people always recognize their wrongs after death?**

Yes, and they often suffer more because clarity increases regret. But repentance may be delayed; some persist stubbornly for a time. Good spirits work to enlighten them—and humans can help too.

**995. Are there spirits who aren’t wicked but are indifferent and inactive?**

Yes. They suffer in proportion to their uselessness, and progress eventually comes—often through suffering—because everything must lead to growth.

**— Don’t they want to shorten their suffering?**

They do, but they lack the will to do what it takes—like people who would rather stay poor than work.

**996. If spirits see the harm caused by evil, why do some keep doing evil as spirits?**

Some delay repentance. And even after repenting, some are pulled back by worse spirits.

**997. Why do some imperfect spirits respond well to prayers while others respond cynically?**

Prayer helps repentant spirits. Proud, rebellious spirits who persist in wrongdoing resist prayer until repentance dawns.

---

### Expiation, Repair, and the Use of Wealth

**998. Is expiation done in the body or in spirit life?**

Both: in the body through trials, in spirit life through mental suffering tied to imperfection.

**999. Is sincere repentance in life enough to erase wrongs and merit grace?**

Repentance helps, but the past still needs to be repaired and expiated.

**1000. Can wrongs be redeemed in the present life?**

Yes—through real reparation. Not through superficial privations or post-death generosity that costs nothing. Repair must strike pride or self-interest to have real moral weight.

**1001. Is there merit in arranging your estate to do good after death?**

It’s better than nothing, but often those who give only after death want the honor without the sacrifice. Giving during life carries both sacrifice and the joy of seeing the good done.

**1002. What if someone realizes their wrongs at death but has no time to repair—does repentance suffice?**

It speeds rehabilitation but doesn’t erase the need for expiation. The future remains open.

---

### The Duration of Future Punishments

**1003. Is the duration of future suffering arbitrary?**

No. God acts through law, not caprice.

**1004. What determines how long a guilty spirit suffers?**

The time it takes to improve. As purification grows, suffering diminishes and transforms.

**1005. Does time feel longer for suffering spirits than when incarnate?**

Yes—because there is no sleep for them. Only more purified spirits experience time differently, as if time fades before the infinite.

**1006. Can suffering be eternal?**

Only if the spirit remained eternally evil—yet God did not create beings destined to eternal evil. All are created simple and ignorant, and all must progress. Even if will is delayed, eventually the need to be happy pushes it toward growth. Duration depends on the spirit’s own effort and free will.

**1007. Are there spirits who never repent?**

They may delay it for a very long time, but “never” would deny the law of progress.

**1008. Are some punishments imposed for a fixed time?**

Yes, some can be, but God always welcomes repentance, and sincere desire to improve is never wasted.

**1009. So punishments are never eternal?**

Not in the absolute sense. Eternal condemnation for brief wrongdoing would contradict divine goodness. “Eternal” language must be read with understanding: it points to the seriousness of consequence, not endless vindictive torture. The deeper aim is redemption, not perpetual revenge.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Many teachings about literal furnaces are outdated allegories. If punishment is presented in a way that violates reason, people reject it—and often reject God with it. A rational, moral view restores faith and responsibility without caricature.

---

### The Resurrection of the Flesh

**1010. Is “resurrection of the flesh” actually referring to reincarnation?**

Yes. Taken literally, it seems absurd, but interpreted logically it aligns with justice and explains what otherwise remains inexplicable.

**1011. Does the Church, through this dogma, teach reincarnation?**

In essence, yes—this meaning is embedded in many teachings and will become clearer with time.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Science shows literal bodily reassembly is impossible because the body’s elements disperse and recycle into countless other bodies. Resurrection makes sense as symbolic language for reincarnation.

---

### Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory

**1012. Are there fixed places in the universe for punishment and pleasure?**

No. Joy and suffering are inherent in the spirit’s degree of perfection. Spirits are everywhere; there is no fenced-off location called “hell” or “heaven.”

**1013. What is “purgatory”?**

A state of physical or mental suffering—an expiatory period. Much of what you call purgatory is experienced on earth through life’s trials.

**1014. Why do some advanced spirits speak in traditional terms about hell and purgatory?**

Sometimes they adapt language to the listener’s framework to avoid shocking them too abruptly.

**— And why do some spirits say *they* are in hell or purgatory?**

Low-order spirits still think in earthly categories and describe their state with familiar terms. “Hell” can mean severe suffering and uncertainty; “purgatory” can mean suffering with hope of improvement.

**1015. What is a “tormented soul”?**

A suffering spirit in the wandering state, uncertain of its future, often seeking consolation through communication.

**1016. What is meant by “heaven”?**

Not a single place where everyone is crowded together in passive bliss, but the vastness of space and the more evolved worlds where spirits live free of material anguish.

**1017. What does it mean when spirits say they are in the “fourth heaven,” “fifth heaven,” etc.?**

They’re using your language of layered heavens. It indicates degrees of purification and happiness, not literal floors in the sky.

*(Commentary paraphrase)* Old imagery of “up” for heaven and “down” for hell came from ancient cosmology. Science undermined those literal locations; Spiritism reframes them as inner states: we carry our hell and heaven within.

**1018. What did Christ mean by “My kingdom is not of this world”?**

Figuratively: Christ reigns in pure, unselfish hearts—where love and goodness rule, not where greed clings to earthly things.

**1019. Will the kingdom of the good be realized on earth?**

Yes, when good spirits outnumber evil among those incarnating here. Moral progress attracts the good and repels the less evolved. A renewed generation will come; those who cannot harmonize with it will move to less advanced worlds to continue learning. Pride and selfishness must fade for this regeneration to stabilize.
