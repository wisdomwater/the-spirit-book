## Chapter 7 — The Return to Corporeal Life

### Preludes to the Return

**330. Do spirits know when they will have to reincarnate?**

Spirits have a sense that their return is drawing near, the way a blind person can feel the warmth of a fire they are approaching. They know that one day they will have to take on a body again, just as we know that one day we will die, but they usually do not know the exact moment.

> *Is reincarnation therefore a necessity of spirit life, as death is a necessity of bodily life?*

Yes. Reincarnation is part of the natural rhythm of spirit life, just as death is part of the natural rhythm of human life.

**331. Do all spirits concern themselves with their approaching reincarnation?**

Not all. Some spirits hardly think about it at all and do not yet understand how it works. Much depends on their level of growth. For certain spirits, not knowing what lies ahead is itself a kind of learning and even a form of correction.

**332. Can spirits hasten or delay the moment of their reincarnation?**

Yes. A spirit can draw its return closer by sincerely desiring to move forward. It can also delay its return if it shrinks back from the challenges ahead. Among spirits, there are courageous ones and also fearful and indifferent ones.

But delaying is not without consequences. A spirit who refuses the next step suffers, like someone who refuses the medicine that would help them heal.

**333. If a spirit felt quite content in an average state among discarnate spirits and had no real desire to grow, could it stay in this wandering state indefinitely?**

Not forever. Growth is woven into the very purpose of spirit life, and sooner or later every spirit feels the inner pull to advance. All must evolve; this is their destiny.

**334. Is the union of a soul with a particular body predestined, or is the choice made at the last moment?**

The spirit is always designated in advance. When a spirit chooses the kind of learning or trial it wants to undertake, it asks to reincarnate; and God, who sees all, already knows which soul will be joined to which body.

**335. Does a spirit have the right to choose the body it will enter, or only the general kind of life that will serve as its trial?**

Spirits sometimes choose both. They may not only choose the type of life but also the kind of body, including its limitations and imperfections. Those very limitations can become opportunities for growth if the spirit meets them with courage and love.

However, this choice is not always entirely in the spirit’s hands. It can request, but God’s wisdom ultimately arranges what best serves that spirit’s journey.

> *At the last moment, can a spirit refuse to enter the body it has chosen?*

It can refuse, but such refusal brings deep suffering—more than if it had not agreed to a new trial at all. Turning away at the threshold postpones and intensifies what must eventually be faced.

**336. Could it happen that no spirit is willing to incarnate in a particular unborn child?**

No. God always provides. When a child is destined to be born alive, a soul has been prepared for that life. Nothing is created without a loving intention behind it.

**337. Can God ever impose the union of a spirit with a particular body?**

Yes. Just as other life circumstances can be imposed as necessary trials, so too can a particular incarnation be assigned—especially when the spirit is not yet able to choose wisely for itself.

Sometimes, as a form of expiation or healing, a spirit may be joined to the body of a child whose birth and place in the world will become a means of confronting what that spirit needs to transform.

**338. If several spirits wished to incarnate in the same body, how would the decision be made?**

Many spirits might desire the same opportunity, but God chooses which one is best suited for the mission that child is meant to fulfill. In truth, the spirit is designated before the very moment it joins the body.

**339. Is the moment of incarnation accompanied by a state of confusion similar to the one following death?**

Yes, but the confusion is deeper and lasts longer. At death, the spirit slips out of confinement; at birth, it enters into it. The transition back into the body is like moving from open air into a narrow space.

**340. Is the moment of incarnation a solemn moment for the spirit? Does it see it as something serious and important?**

Yes. The spirit is like a traveler embarking on a dangerous voyage, not knowing what storms may come or whether the ship will reach its destination.

Like travelers, spirits know they are going into unknown waters. They are aware of the kinds of trials that await them, but not whether they will succeed or fail in living them well.

Reincarnation, then, is like a temporary death to the freedom of the spirit world; it is a kind of exile and confinement. Just as leaving the human body is a rebirth into spirit life, leaving spirit life is an entrance into the dense world of matter. The spirit senses its return, but becomes clearly aware only as the moment draws near. A cloud of confusion gathers, similar to what happens at the moment of death, and lasts until the new life is fully established. The beginning of reincarnation is, in a way, a “death throe” on the spirit’s side.

**341. Does a spirit’s uncertainty about whether it will endure its trials successfully cause anxiety before reincarnating?**

Yes. It often causes great anxiety. The way a spirit lives its next life can either slow down or speed up its growth, depending on whether it bears its trials with courage or resists them.

**342. At the moment of reincarnation, is the spirit accompanied by loving spirit friends who help it leave the spirit world, just as they come to greet it when it returns?**

That depends on the realm it inhabits. In spheres where love and mutual care are strong, friends accompany the spirit to the threshold. They encourage it and often continue to surround it with support throughout its life.

**343. Are the spirit friends who follow us throughout life the same ones we sometimes see in dreams—those who show affection even though we do not recognize them physically?**

Very often, yes. They come to visit you as you might visit a loved one who is temporarily confined in prison: to comfort, to encourage, and to remind you that you are not alone.

### The Joining of the Soul with the Body. Abortion

**344. At what moment does the soul actually join the body?**

The connection begins at conception but is only completed at birth. From the very moment of conception, the spirit assigned to that life is linked to the developing body by a subtle, fluid bond that grows stronger as birth approaches. The newborn’s first cries are like a proclamation that it has entered the human family and joined the ranks of God’s servants on earth.

**345. Is the union between spirit and body definitive from the moment of conception? In this early stage, could the spirit still refuse to inhabit the designated body?**

The union is definitive in the sense that no other spirit will be assigned to that body. However, the bond is still delicate and can be broken. A spirit that shrinks back from the trial it chose can sever the connection, and in that case, the child does not survive.

**346. What happens to a spirit if the body it has chosen dies before birth?**

It chooses another opportunity, another body, another path for the same lesson.

> *What is the purpose of such premature deaths?*

Often it is simply due to the imperfections of matter. Not every body can carry life to term. These failures are not wasted; they are woven into a larger tapestry that we do not fully see from here.

**347. What benefit can a spirit gain from incarnating into a body that dies a few days after birth?**

In such a brief earthly life, the spirit has hardly had time to be fully conscious through the body. The impact on the spirit is minimal. But these early deaths are often profound trials for the parents, touching their hearts and calling them toward deeper compassion, surrender, and faith.

**348. Does a spirit know beforehand that the body it has chosen has little chance of survival?**

Sometimes it does. And occasionally a spirit will choose such a body precisely to avoid a longer trial it feels unready to face. This too becomes part of its learning.

**349. When an incarnation fails for any reason, does the spirit immediately receive another earthly life?**

Not always. The spirit may need time to reflect, to choose again, and to prepare. Sometimes an immediate return is arranged; sometimes there is a pause in the spirit state before the next life.

**350. Once a spirit is firmly united to the body of a child and can no longer withdraw, does it ever regret its choice?**

As a human being, the incarnate spirit may complain, feel overwhelmed, or wish for another life. It may even come to the point of wanting to end that life.

But it does not consciously remember having chosen these conditions, so it cannot “regret” that choice in the way we regret something we remember clearly. It simply feels the weight of its burden. If it believes that burden is too heavy to bear, it may be tempted toward suicide.

**351. In the period between conception and birth, does the spirit enjoy all its faculties?**

To a greater or lesser degree, depending on the stage of development. During this time, the spirit is not fully incarnated; it is attached, but not yet fully embedded in matter.

From the moment of conception, a kind of confusion begins to surround the spirit, signaling that a new chapter of existence is beginning. This confusion deepens until birth. Its state is somewhat like that of an incarnate spirit during sleep.

As birth approaches, memories and clear ideas fade. The spirit’s conscious awareness of its past recedes, and when it fully enters earthly life, it no longer remembers who it has been. Those memories return little by little when it once again leaves the body and returns to the spirit world.

**352. At the moment of birth, does the spirit immediately recover the full use of its faculties?**

No. The soul’s faculties unfold as the bodily organs develop. The spirit finds itself in a new situation and must learn how to use the tools of this new body. Its ideas and inner light re-emerge gradually, like someone waking from a deep sleep into a life that feels both familiar and new.

**353. Since the union of spirit and body is not complete and final until after birth, can the fetus be considered as having a soul?**

The spirit that will animate it exists and is already linked to it, but in a way still external. Strictly speaking, the incarnation is still in process, not yet fully accomplished. Still, the fetus is connected to the soul that is coming; the story has already begun.

**354. How can we understand life in the womb?**

It is like the germination of a seed. The fetus lives a bodily, animal life. Even then, human beings already carry a kind of plant–animal vitality within them, which is later crowned at birth by the awakening of spiritual life in the body.

**355. Medical science has identified infants who, even before birth, have no real chance of surviving. Why are such lives permitted?**

This is a common occurrence that God allows as a trial—sometimes for the parents, sometimes for the spirit designated for that body. Even short and fragile lives are not meaningless; they touch hearts deeply and can awaken profound spiritual work.

**356. Are there stillborn infants in whom no spirit was ever meant to incarnate?**

Yes. In some cases, no spirit was ever truly joined to that body in a definitive way. Nothing of spiritual growth is taking place in that child; the event is purely for the parents’ path—an experience that will shape their hearts and choices.

> *Can a being like that be carried to term?*

Yes, sometimes, but it will not live long after birth.

> *Then every child who survives necessarily has a spirit incarnated in it?*

Of course. Without a spirit, it would not be a human being.

**357. What are the consequences of abortion for the spirit?**

If the incarnation is cut short, that particular earthly life is simply interrupted and will have to begin again in another body, at another time. The spirit will still seek out the experiences it needs, perhaps in a different way.

**358. Is artificial abortion a moral wrong regardless of the stage of pregnancy?**

Whenever the divine law of love is knowingly violated, a wrong is committed. Someone who deliberately ends a life in the womb takes away the opportunity for a soul to live out the trials and growth that would have unfolded through that body.

The seriousness of that act depends on intention, awareness, and circumstances. Yet, at its core, it is the interruption of a path chosen for growth, both for the spirit and for those around it.

**359. If the mother’s life would be endangered by the birth of the child, is it wrong to sacrifice the child to save the mother?**

In such a tragic situation, it is better to preserve the life that is already established and conscious in the world, rather than one that has not yet begun its full earthly experience. These decisions must be approached with reverence, humility, and compassion, trusting that God’s mercy embraces both mother and child.

**360. Is it reasonable to treat the fetus with the same respect as the body of a child who has already survived?**

Yes. In all stages of life, we are invited to see the hand of God at work and to treat that work with reverence. Even when something seems incomplete to us, it is part of a larger design.

We do not always understand why some lives are brief or fragile, but we are not asked to judge God’s plans—only to honor life and respond with care, gentleness, and respect.

### The Moral and Intellectual Faculties of Humankind

**361. Where do a person’s good or evil moral qualities come from?**

They reflect the qualities of the spirit incarnated in that person. The purer the spirit, the more naturally inclined the person is toward what is good, kind, and just.

> *So is a moral person the incarnation of a good spirit, and a cruel person the incarnation of an evil spirit?*

It is better to say an imperfect spirit rather than an “evil” one. Otherwise, you might imagine beings eternally fixed in evil, which is not so. Spirits can always grow and be transformed.

**362. What kind of character do people have when frivolous or foolish spirits are incarnated in them?**

They tend to be superficial, thoughtless, scheming, and sometimes deliberately hurtful or mischievous. Their lives often revolve around self-pleasure and games, without much concern for depth or responsibility.

**363. Do spirits have any passions that human beings do not?**

No. If they did, you would experience those passions too. What you see in human life reflects, in some form, the inner movements of spirits.

**364. Is it the same spirit that gives a person both their moral and intellectual qualities?**

Yes. One and the same spirit carries both moral and intellectual potential. The way these qualities show up in a person depends on how far that spirit has advanced. There are not two different spirits inside a person, one for character and one for intellect.

**365. Why are some highly intelligent people—who seem to have a very advanced spirit—sometimes extremely cruel at the same time?**

Because their spirit is not yet purified in all aspects. They may be advanced in knowledge but lag behind in love.

They can also be influenced by other, even less evolved spirits that align with their unresolved tendencies. Spiritual growth is gradual and not always balanced. In one period a spirit may progress greatly in understanding; in another, in compassion and morality. These do not always develop at the same pace.

**366. What about the idea that different moral and intellectual qualities in a person come from many different spirits living in them, each with its own special aptitude?**

If you think this through, you will see that it does not hold. Each spirit is meant to be whole, carrying all the seeds of different abilities and virtues. It needs a unified will to grow.

If a person were a collection of many spirits, there would be no true individuality or responsibility. At death, those spirits would disperse like a flock of birds flying out of the same cage. The person would not be a single “someone,” but a temporary cluster.

People often complicate spiritual matters unnecessarily. This theory simply confuses effect and cause, much like ancient religions once multiplied gods to explain every natural phenomenon, instead of recognizing a single divine Source behind them all.

In reality, the many facets of our personality flow from one soul, one incarnate spirit. Our different abilities and traits are like the many notes of an organ: they all arise from the same air passing through different pipes, not from many different airs living inside the instrument.

If we said that every change in aptitude meant new spirits coming or going, we would end up with a picture of human beings as fragmented, without a stable identity and without true accountability. Yet spirit manifestations clearly show that each spirit is personal, continuous, and recognizable.

### The Influence of the Organism

**367. When a spirit joins the body, does it become identified with matter?**

No. Matter is only the spirit’s outer garment, the way clothing is the body’s covering. Even when joined to the body, the spirit remains what it is—immaterial and spiritual—clothed for a time in flesh.

**368. Does the spirit exercise its faculties with full freedom once it is united to the body?**

Its freedom is limited by the tools it must use. The spirit’s faculties operate through bodily organs, and those organs can restrict and dim its expression. Dense matter is like a thick fog over a bright light.

> *So is the body like an opaque glass that blocks the light of the spirit’s faculties?*

Yes—very much so. You might also imagine heavy, muddy water that slows the movement of an object immersed in it. The spirit is still there, but its expression is hindered.

**369. Is the free exercise of the soul’s faculties dependent on the development of the bodily organs?**

Yes. The organs are instruments through which the soul manifests. The clarity and power of that manifestation depend in part on how mature and healthy those instruments are, much like the quality of a piece of work depends on the quality of the tools used.

**370. From this influence of the organs, can we infer a link between the development of the brain and a person’s moral and intellectual qualities?**

Be careful not to confuse effect with cause. The spirit already possesses its own faculties. The organs do not create the faculties; rather, the spirit’s faculties shape and stimulate the development of the organs.

> *So does the diversity of aptitudes among individuals come only from the condition of their spirit?*

“Only” is too strong a word. The spirit’s level of advancement is the primary source of diversity, but the body also plays a role. Matter can hinder or distort expression to varying degrees, and this too affects how abilities appear.

When a spirit incarnates, it brings certain tendencies and gifts. If you imagine that there might be a corresponding brain area for each capacity, then the development of those areas is a result, not a cause. If we claimed the opposite—that organs create faculties—then humans would be nothing more than machines, excused from responsibility. Genius would be sheer accident of brain structure, and the most ordinary person could have become a Newton or a Raphael if given the right arrangement of cells.

The same logic would apply to moral qualities: a saint could have been cruel if their brain were different, and a cruel person could have been a saint with different wiring. This is contrary to the deeper truth of spiritual responsibility.

It is more accurate to say that the spirit’s repeated use of certain faculties shapes the body, the way repeated movements build muscles, or the way long-term habits etch their mark on a face. The organs receive the imprint of the faculties, not the other way around.

### Mental Impairment, Insanity

**371. Is there any truth in the idea that people with mental impairment have souls of a primitive or undeveloped nature?**

No. They have a human soul, often more intelligent and sensitive than you might imagine. They suffer deeply from the constraints of a body and brain that do not allow their thoughts and feelings to be clearly expressed—like a mute person who suffers from being unable to speak.

**372. What is the purpose in allowing beings with mental impairment to exist?**

The spirits living in such bodies are undergoing a kind of expiation or healing of past imbalances. They experience the constraint of their condition and the frustration of not being able to express themselves because the brain is underdeveloped or damaged.

> *Doesn’t this show that the organs really do influence the faculties?*

We have never said the organs have no influence. They greatly affect how faculties are expressed. But they do not create those faculties. A gifted musician will struggle to play well on a broken instrument, yet remains a gifted musician nonetheless.

There is a difference between normal limitation and pathological disruption. In ordinary conditions, the spirit can often overcome bodily limitations to some degree. In cases of serious mental illness or impairment, matter puts up such resistance that clear expression becomes distorted or impossible. In those states, human law rightly recognizes that the person is not fully in possession of their reasoning and treats them differently in terms of responsibility.

**373. What value is there in the lives of those who, like the mentally impaired, can do neither clear good nor clear harm, and thus seem unable to progress?**

Their condition is a temporary pause and a form of expiation for the misuse of certain faculties in a previous life. The apparent lack of outward activity does not mean there is no inner work happening.

> *Could the body of a mentally impaired person contain a spirit who was once a genius in a previous existence?*

Yes. Genius can become a burden when it is misused. A spirit who once shone with great brilliance may experience in a later life the severe limits of a mind that cannot easily function. This is a painful but transformative reversal.

Moral greatness and intellectual greatness do not always go together. Some of the greatest geniuses have much to repair and purify. A later, more limited existence can become a path toward deep humility and healing.

**374. In the spirit state, are mentally impaired persons aware of their condition?**

Often, yes. They understand that the chains that limited their expression were part of a trial and a form of correction. Their clarity returns when they are no longer bound to the impaired organ.

**375. What is the situation of the spirit in a state of insanity?**

When free of the body, the spirit receives impressions directly and acts directly on matter. Once incarnated, it must work through specific organs. If some of those organs—especially those related to intelligence and will—are altered or damaged, the spirit’s communication is disrupted.

A spirit in such a situation is often fully aware inwardly, but powerless to correct the distorted signals the damaged organ sends and receives. It is like a skilled violinist trying to play on a shattered instrument.

> *So is it always the body, and not the spirit, that is disordered?*

Yes. But remember: just as the spirit influences matter, matter also affects the spirit’s experience to a certain extent. The altered organ can temporarily cloud the spirit’s expressions and perceptions. If insanity lasts a long time, the repeated patterns imposed by the illness can leave a kind of lingering impression on the spirit, which it must shake off after death. The full sense of freedom and clarity may take time to return.

**376. Why does insanity sometimes lead to suicide?**

Because the spirit suffers intensely from feeling imprisoned and unable to communicate or act freely. In its desperation, it may seek to break its chains through death, not realizing that this does not resolve everything as simply as it hopes.

**377. After death, does the spirit of a mentally impaired person still feel the disruption of its faculties?**

For a while, yes. Although it is free of the body, it may still feel the “echo” of its former confusion. Just as we may wake from a deep and troubling dream and need time to orient ourselves, so too does the spirit need time to fully regain its clarity.

**378. How can an impairment of the brain still affect the spirit after death?**

What lingers is the memory and impression of that condition. The spirit feels a kind of heaviness or fog until it understands its new state and fully disconnects from the influence of the body it once inhabited.

The longer the insanity lasts in life, the longer this after-effect may last. The spirit continues to feel, for a time, the imprint of its former bonds until it is completely free of any material influence.

### Childhood

**379. Is the spirit that animates a child’s body as developed as the spirit in an adult?**

It may be even more advanced. The limitation lies not in the spirit, but in the child’s immature body and brain. The spirit can only express as much as its small and unfinished instrument allows.

**380. In a very young child, despite the limitations of its organs, does the spirit think as a child or as an adult?**

Because the organ of intelligence is still developing, the spirit’s conscious life through the body is limited. Its reasoning remains simple until age and growth unfold its capacities.

The confusion of incarnation does not vanish at birth; it slowly lifts as the organs mature. This is why children’s dreams and concerns are often simple—they reflect the kinds of thoughts that can be expressed through their young brains.

**381. At a child’s death, does the spirit immediately regain its full strength and clarity?**

It should, because it is freed from the body. However, complete lucidity returns only when every remaining link between the spirit and the body is dissolved. There is a gentle transition.

**382. Does the spirit suffer from the limitations imposed by childhood?**

No. Childhood is part of the divine plan. It is a natural and necessary phase, a time of rest and gentle transition for the spirit as it settles into a new life.

**383. What is the purpose of a spirit having to go through childhood?**

The spirit incarnates to grow and purify itself. During childhood, it is especially open and impressionable. This makes it more receptive to guidance, tenderness, and teaching that can help its progress.

Those responsible for a child’s upbringing have a sacred task: to cooperate with this inner work of the spirit by nurturing goodness, wisdom, and love.

**384. Why are a child’s first expressions mostly cries?**

Crying draws the mother’s attention and ensures the child receives the care it needs. If an infant had only smiles and laughter while still unable to speak, its needs might be overlooked. Even here, you can see the wisdom of Providence—everything is arranged to protect the fragile.

**385. Why does a child’s character often change around adolescence? Does the spirit itself change?**

What is happening is that the spirit’s true character begins to show more clearly as the body matures. The innocence of early childhood hides many complexities. You do not know who this spirit has been, what it has done, or what it is capable of becoming, and yet you love and cherish it as if it were part of your own heart.

God gives children the outward appearance of innocence so that we are drawn to care for them. Even when a child has difficult tendencies, their misdeeds are softened by their lack of full awareness. This appearance protects both them and their bond with their caregivers.

If parents had to face from the beginning a harsh or quarrelsome character in a tiny body, the love needed for that child’s survival might be weakened. Instead, supposing their children to be gentle and good, parents pour out affection and care.

When children no longer require such total protection—after fifteen or twenty years—this veil lifts. Their true character emerges. If the spirit is fundamentally good, that goodness remains, but nuances and deeper traits begin to show.

God’s ways are wise. Consider that the spirit who arrives among you may have come from a very different world, with habits unlike yours. Childhood is a kind of sieve through which all those previous habits must pass in order for the spirit to adapt to life on earth.

In the same way, when you leave this world, you will enter new environments where customs and ways of relating are unfamiliar. You will go through your own sort of “childhood” there, learning a new language of the heart.

Childhood also serves another purpose: in those early, tender years, the spirit is more flexible and open to reform. That is the best time to soften harsh tendencies, cultivate virtue, and shape character. This is the holy duty God entrusts to parents and caregivers—a mission for which they will one day give account.

Childhood is therefore not just useful, but necessary and indispensable. It flows naturally from the laws God has set in motion for the growth of souls and the harmony of the universe.

### Earthly Sympathies and Antipathies

**386. Can two people who loved each other in a previous life meet again in another incarnation and recognize one another?**

They do not usually recognize each other consciously, but they may feel a deep, immediate attraction or closeness. Many intimate bonds that arise seemingly “by chance” are actually the result of two spirits finding each other again amid the crowds of earth.

> *Wouldn’t it be a joy for them to consciously recognize each other?*

Not always. Remembering past lives in detail could sometimes bring more burdens than blessings. After death, they will recognize each other clearly and remember the times they have shared. That is when such knowledge is harmless and comforting.

**387. Is every deep sympathy between two people the result of having known each other before?**

Not necessarily. Two spirits can be drawn to each other simply because they are of a similar nature and resonate deeply, even if they have not been together in previous incarnations.

**388. Are the “chance” encounters between certain people sometimes the effect of a subtle sympathetic link?**

Yes. Among conscious beings there are subtle connections you do not yet fully understand. What you call “magnetism” is at the heart of this mystery, and one day you will perceive it more clearly.

**389. Where does instinctive repulsion come from when certain individuals meet for the first time?**

It is often the reaction of antipathetic spirits who recognize each other inwardly without having exchanged a word. There is a clash in their inner vibrations.

**390. Is instinctive antipathy always a sign that one of the spirits is bad?**

No. Two spirits may simply be very different in their way of thinking and feeling. As they advance, these differences soften and the antipathy fades.

**391. Does antipathy arise first in the spirit who is worse or in the spirit who is better?**

It arises in both, but in different ways.

The less-evolved spirit feels antipathy toward the other because it senses that the other can see through it, judge it, and not be impressed by it. This antipathy can turn into hatred, envy, and the desire to harm.

The more-evolved spirit, on the other hand, is simply repelled by what it perceives as coarse or harmful. It knows there is little understanding possible between them. But grounded in higher principles, it does not respond with hatred or jealousy. It simply keeps a respectful distance and, when it can, responds with quiet compassion.

### Forgetfulness of the Past

**392. Why does the incarnate spirit lose the memory of its past lives?**

Because humans cannot and should not know everything. God, in wisdom, has placed a veil over our past. Without it, we would be dazzled and overwhelmed, as if we had walked suddenly from a dark room into blinding sunlight.

Forgetting the details of our past allows us to live more fully in the present, to focus on the choices before us now.

**393. How can people be responsible for their actions and repair their wrongs if they don’t remember them? How can they benefit from lessons learned in previous lives if those lives are forgotten?**

With each new life, spirits gain more intelligence and a clearer sense of right and wrong. Their merit lies precisely in choosing the good without having to be constantly reminded of past failures.

When spirits return to the spirit world, their whole past is opened to them. They see clearly the wrongs they have done and the suffering those wrongs have caused. They also see what would have kept them from making those choices. They recognize the justice of their situation and often ask for a new life in which they can repair and grow.

They seek trials similar to those they failed before, or experiences they believe will help them develop. They ask for guidance from more advanced spirits, knowing that a spiritual guide will walk with them and, in a quiet way, remind them of what they have resolved to change.

This reminder is what you often experience as conscience, or as a troubling thought or temptation that you resist without fully knowing why. You may attribute that resistance to your upbringing or principles learned from loved ones. But beneath that, it is the echo of your own past—a memory of the heart—warning you not to fall into the same patterns again.

If in this new life the spirit embraces its trials with courage and faith, it grows and rises in the spiritual hierarchy when it returns to the spirit world.

Even though we do not remember clearly, we carry an intuition of our past within our instincts and tendencies. Our conscience and our recurring inner struggles are like signposts pointing to the work still to be done.

**394. On more advanced worlds, whose inhabitants are not subject to our physical needs and infirmities, do they understand that they are happier than we are? If they do not remember a more painful state, how can they appreciate their situation?**

There are two types of more advanced worlds to consider.

On some of them, the inhabitants do remember their past lives consciously and clearly. They know what they have left behind, and they deeply appreciate the happiness God allows them to enjoy.

On other worlds, conditions are better than on earth, but there are still trials and even misfortunes. The inhabitants of these worlds do not necessarily value their relative happiness because they do not remember having been in harsher conditions. They still complain, just as wealthy people on earth complain about their troubles despite being free from material need.

Even if they do not appreciate their situation while incarnated, they will understand more fully as spirits.

In all this, there is a deep tenderness: if those who now suffer on earth had to carry the vivid memory of many painful lifetimes, their present burdens might feel unbearable. The veil is a mercy.

**395. Can we receive revelations about our previous lives?**

Sometimes. Certain spirits are allowed to know who they were and what they did. If they were permitted to speak freely, they could share many striking stories. But such revelations are rare and given only when they serve a true spiritual purpose, not mere curiosity.

**396. Some people feel they have a vague memory of an unknown past—like a fleeting image in a dream that they cannot quite hold onto. Is this always an illusion?**

Sometimes it is genuine; often it is not. The imagination is powerful, and we must be cautious. Not every feeling of “having been here before” is a true memory; some are simply the mind weaving its own patterns.

**397. In more evolved corporeal existences, is the memory of previous lives clearer?**

Yes. The less material the body, the easier it is for the spirit’s memories to shine through. On higher worlds, spirits remember their past much more readily than humans do on earth.

**398. Since our instinctive tendencies are reminders of our past, can we discover what wrongs we have committed by studying those tendencies?**

To some extent, yes. By observing your tendencies—especially those that pull you toward selfishness, pride, or harm—you can glimpse where your soul is still healing.

However, you must also remember that the spirit may have improved during its time in the spirit world and may have made new resolutions. So your present life can be better than your last, even if some old tendencies still linger.

> *Could our present life be worse than our previous one? In other words, can we commit wrongs now that we did not commit before?*

That depends on our level of advancement. If we still do not know how to hold steady in the face of trials, we might fall into new kinds of errors shaped by the conditions we ourselves have chosen. This does not mean we are going backward; rather, we may be lingering at the same level, confronting our weaknesses from different angles. Spirits can advance or remain stationary for a time, but they do not move backwards in their deepest nature.

**399. Since the hardships of life serve both as expiation for past wrongs and as trials for future growth, can we deduce the kind of past life we had from the nature of our present troubles?**

Often, yes. Many times we are allowed to experience in ourselves what we have caused others to endure. There is a deep justice in that.

But it is not an absolute rule. Your instinctive tendencies are usually a more reliable guide than your outer circumstances alone, because the trials of this life are not only about the past but also about what you are being invited to become.

When the period of wandering between lives reaches its appointed time, spirits choose the kinds of trials that can help them grow. They pick the conditions that will both heal the past and open the future. If they embrace these trials well, they progress; if they resist or collapse into bitterness, they must face similar lessons again.

Spirits always retain free will. In the spirit state, they choose the broad outline of their next life; in the earthly state, they choose at each moment how to respond. If we denied this freedom, we would reduce human beings to mere machines.

The veil over our past does not block our growth. We still carry the knowledge of our former wrongs in our deeper consciousness, and we still feel the desire to repair them. This desire speaks in us as conscience, and it is supported by loving spirits who whisper encouragement and guidance. If we listen, we will not walk alone.

Even without specific memories, we can know what we are healing by honestly looking at ourselves—our tendencies, our weaknesses, and the kinds of challenges we face. In this mirror, we can see hints of who we have been and, more importantly, who we are called to become.

The hardships of life—sorrow, limitations, injustices—can purify and lift us if we accept them with humble trust, without bitterness or constant complaint. In this way, the very things that once felt like punishments become the tools of our redemption and the soil of our awakening.
