## CHAPTER VI — Spirit Life

### Errant Spirits

**223. Does the soul reincarnate immediately after separation from the body?**

Most of the time, no. Sometimes a soul takes on a new body quickly, but often there is a pause — an interval of rest and reflection.

On more spiritually advanced worlds, where bodies are lighter and less dense, reincarnation is almost immediate, because the body doesn’t cloud the spirit’s awareness the way it does here.

**224. What becomes of the soul during the intervals between incarnations?**

It lives as an *errant* spirit — a traveler between earthly lives, aware, learning, and preparing for its next step.

> *How long may such intervals last?*

They may last from hours to centuries. There is no fixed outer limit. Every spirit eventually resumes its journey in a new incarnation.

> *Does the length of the interval depend on the spirit’s own will, or can it be imposed as an expiation?*

Often, the interval reflects the spirit’s own choice — its desire to rest, study, or stay awhile in the spiritual state. But in some cases, a longer or more constrained interval can be part of a corrective process allowed by God, especially when the soul needs time to understand and repent. Some souls also request longer intervals to pursue learning that is easier in the spirit state.

**225. Is the errant state in and of itself an indication of spirits who are less evolved?**

No. All spirits who still need to grow pass through errant states. You can find spirits at every degree of development between incarnations. Incarnation is the temporary school; spirit-life is the soul’s natural condition.

**226. Could we say that all spirits who are not incarnate are errant?**

Not all. Those who have already reached purity and perfection are no longer “errant” — their state is stable and fulfilled. Only spirits who still need to reincarnate are called errant.

**227. How do errant spirits learn, since it can hardly be in the same way as for us?**

They learn by:

* reviewing their past lives,
* observing what happens in different realms,
* listening to more advanced spirits,
* and reflecting deeply on what love and justice require.

Their learning is contemplative and intuitive, but very real.

**228. Do spirits retain any of the human passions?**

It depends on their level.

High spirits leave lower passions behind and retain only the love of the good. Less-evolved spirits carry their earthly tendencies with them — jealousy, greed, hatred, pride — until they are healed.

**229. When they leave the earth behind, why don’t spirits abandon their evil passions since they are able to see the trouble they can cause?**

Because character doesn’t change by death alone.

Spirits who were strongly attached to material desires retain a sort of “atmosphere” around them—a lingering field of their old habits and cravings. They may see some of the harm these caused, but they are not yet free of the inner pull. They get glimpses of truth, but the full transformation takes time and effort.

**230. Can a spirit progress while in the errant state?**

Yes. It can grow in understanding, humility, and intention.

But it is through new incarnations — where choices have real consequences in time and matter — that it puts this understanding into practice and consolidates its progress.

**231. Are errant spirits happy or unhappy?**

Their state mirrors their inner condition:

* If they are attached to selfish desires or guilt, they experience restlessness and anxiety.
* If they are more detached and purified, they enjoy peace, clarity, and hope.

Some suffer because they long for a new opportunity to grow and are not yet ready to receive it.

**232. While in the errant state, can spirits visit other worlds?**

Yes, but within the limits of their development.

Spirits still marked by matter generally remain close to worlds of a similar level. More advanced spirits can visit more refined realms — sometimes only as observers — and what they glimpse there awakens a longing to grow.

**233. Do spirits who are already purified ever go to less evolved worlds?**

Yes. They go as helpers, guides, and teachers.

Their presence is a form of mercy — without such spirits, lower worlds would lack higher examples and direction.

### Transitional Worlds

**234. As some have stated, are there worlds that serve as layovers and resting places for errant spirits?**

Yes. There are worlds that serve as “waystations” — places where spirits rest, reflect, and prepare between incarnations.

> *Can the spirits who occupy such worlds leave whenever they wish?*

Yes, when the time is right and they are ready to continue their journey. These worlds are like islands where migrating birds pause, gather strength, and then take flight again.

**235. Do spirits progress during their layovers on these transitory worlds?**

Yes. These worlds are schools and retreat centers for the soul. Spirits gather there precisely to learn, refine themselves, and ready their hearts for higher stages.

**236. Due to their special nature, are these transitional worlds destined forever to be layovers for errant spirits?**

No. Their role as layovers is temporary and evolves over time.

> *Are they inhabited by corporeal beings at the same time?*

No. Their surface is generally barren of physical life as we know it. The spirits who dwell there do not need material bodies.

> *Is this barrenness permanent, and is it connected to their special nature?*

No. The barrenness is not necessarily permanent. It’s a phase suited to their current function.

> *Then are these worlds destitute of natural beauties?*

They have a different kind of beauty — vastness, serenity, and clarity that reflect their purpose. Their “scenery” is more about spiritual atmosphere than plants and oceans.

> *Since the state of these worlds is transitory, will the earth be among them someday?*

It already was, in its earliest stages.

> *At what period?*

During its formation, before it became suitable for the kind of material life we know.

### Perceptions, Sensations, and Sufferings of Spirits

**237. Once in the world of spirits, does the soul still have the perceptions it had in this life?**

Yes — and more.

The body is like a thick veil over consciousness. When the veil is removed, the spirit’s native clarity and receptivity are freed and expanded.

**238. Are the perceptions and understanding of spirits unlimited? In other words, do they know everything?**

No.

The closer a spirit draws to perfection, the more it knows. High spirits have vast knowledge; low spirits may know little more than they did on earth.

**239. Do spirits comprehend the beginning of things?**

Some do, according to their elevation.

Lower spirits are as limited as we are; they do not comprehend the deepest origins of creation. Higher spirits perceive more of God’s designs, but only God fully knows the beginning of all things.

**240. Do spirits perceive time as we do?**

No.

For them, what we call “time” stretches and compresses. Centuries can feel like moments. This difference is one reason their communications are often vague about earthly dates and exact timelines.

**241. Do spirits have a more correct and precise idea of the present than we do?**

Generally yes.

They see more and from a higher vantage point. But again, this depends on their level. A more evolved spirit sees reality more clearly, just as a person with sight sees more than one who is blind.

**242. How do spirits have knowledge about the past?**

> *Is such knowledge unlimited for them?

They remember what matters.

Events that deeply marked their conscience are present to them—almost as if they were happening now. Lesser details may fade or be ignored. Their knowledge of the past is not absolutely unlimited, but their memory is freer and clearer than ours, especially once they are detached from matter.

**243. Do spirits know the future?**

> *Do spirits who have reached perfection possess complete knowledge of the future?*

To varying degrees.

More evolved spirits may see tendencies, likely outcomes, and certain destined events, as if looking from a height over a landscape. But they are not always permitted to reveal what they see.

Even the highest spirits do not know *everything*—complete foreknowledge belongs to God alone.

**244. Do spirits see God?**

Only the most purified spirits truly “see” and comprehend God. Less evolved spirits sense God through intuition, inner warning, and the quiet pressure of conscience.

> *When a low order spirit says that a thing is forbidden or permitted to it by God, how does it know that the order has actually come from God?*

It does not see God directly, but it feels divine authority in itself: inner checks, warnings, and intuitions that say “yes” or “no.” These are spiritual echoes of God’s law.

> *Is the order transmitted by God directly or through other spirits?*

Usually through more advanced spirits who serve as messengers and guides. To be in direct communion with God requires a level of purity very few have attained.

**245. Is spirits’ sight circumscribed as it is in corporeal beings?**

No.

Spiritual perception is not limited to a pair of eyes. The whole being is capable of perceiving, and what we call “sight” is a function of consciousness, not organs.

**246. Do spirits need light in order to see?**

No.

They see by their own inner light. There is no darkness for spirits except the darkness of confusion and attachment in their own soul.

**247. Do spirits need to move about in order to see in two different places? For instance, can they see what is happening simultaneously in two hemispheres of the globe?**

They can perceive multiple places at once, especially more evolved spirits.

Their perception travels with thought. Movement, for them, is not constrained by physical distance as ours is.

**248. Do spirits see things as distinctly as we do?**

Even more distinctly.

They can see beyond appearances, through surfaces, into causes and inner states. Material obstacles do not block their perception.

**249. Do spirits perceive sounds?**

Yes, but their perception of “sound” is not limited to air vibrations or ears.

> *Is the hearing faculty, like that of sight, in their whole being?*

Yes. Spiritual hearing, like spiritual sight, is a property of consciousness itself, not localized in organs. It is as if their entire being is capable of resonating with what is communicated.

**250. Since the perceptions are attributes of the spirit itself, can it stop using them?**

Spirits can focus or relax their attention.

They usually perceive what they choose to perceive, especially higher spirits. But lower spirits, when it is for their good, may be made aware of certain realities whether they desire it or not, to prompt their growth.

**251. Are spirits sensitive to music?**

Yes — profoundly so.

What we call music is a faint echo of the harmonies of higher realms. Ordinary spirits may enjoy human music, but more purified spirits are attuned to far more delicate and immense harmonies that we cannot yet imagine.

**252. Are spirits sensitive to the beauties of nature?**

Yes.

As they advance, they are drawn not just to isolated beauties (a flower, a mountain) but to the harmony of the whole. They perceive the beauty of God’s order across worlds.

**253. Do spirits experience our physical needs and sufferings?**

They remember and understand them, because they have lived them. But they do not feel hunger, thirst, or bodily pain in the same way once they are disembodied.

**254. Do spirits feel fatigue and the need for rest?**

Not as we do.

They have no organs to wear out. Still, their thought and activity have rhythms. When their attention is not directed toward anything in particular, this “quieting” of thought is their form of rest.

**255. When a spirit says that it is suffering, what is the nature of such suffering?**

Primarily inner suffering — mental, moral, emotional.

Remorse, fear, loneliness, attachment, or the shock of recognizing truth can cause a sharp anguish more intense than bodily pain.

**256. Why do some spirits complain about the cold or heat?**

These expressions often reflect memory or symbolism rather than literal temperature.

The spirit may feel as though it is still linked to its body, or it may use familiar images to describe an inner discomfort.

### Theoretical Essay on Sensation in Spirits (257)

This section explains, in more reflective terms, how the perispirit (the subtle body) serves as the bridge between matter and spirit, and how suffering after death:

* is not physical in the earthly sense,
* arises from moral states and lingering attachments,
* and diminishes as the soul purifies and detaches from matter.

The key idea: **we sow our future sensations by how we live now**. As we loosen the grip of selfishness, pride, and fixation on bodily pleasures, we become lighter and less vulnerable to post-mortem suffering.

### The Choice of Trials

**258. While in the errant state and before a new corporeal existence, does a spirit have the awareness and foresight of what will happen to it during its new lifetime?**

Yes. The spirit sees the broad outline of the life to come and chooses the general kinds of trials and conditions it will encounter.

> *Then it is not God who imposes the tribulations of life on it as a chastisement?*

God provides the framework and the laws, but the spirit chooses how to walk within them. Trials are not arbitrary punishments, but opportunities the soul accepts for growth, repair, and learning.

**259. If our spirit chooses the kinds of trials it will undergo, are all the tribulations of life therefore foreseen and chosen by us?**

Not every detail.

We choose the *type* of life: health or fragility, wealth or poverty, social setting, main lessons. The countless daily events arise from this framework, from our choices, and from the interplay of other souls’ freedom.

**260. Why would a spirit want to be born among evildoers?**

Because the chosen trial may require immersion in certain temptations or environments.

To overcome violence, it may be born among the violent. To conquer greed, among the greedy.

> *If there were no longer any evil individuals on earth, would spirits not be able to find the necessary conditions for certain trials?*

High-level worlds exist where evil has no foothold, and only good souls incarnate there. If earth reaches that stage, trials will no longer require exposure to gross evil; they will be of a more subtle and refined kind.

**261. In the trials it has to undergo to reach perfection, must a spirit experience every type of temptation possible? In other words, will it have to go through all the circumstances that can trigger pride, jealousy, greed, lust, etc.?**

No.

A spirit does not need to taste every form of disorder. Some progress quickly, choosing paths that spare them many dangers; others experiment with many forms of selfishness and suffer the consequences. The goal is not to sample all evils, but to uproot the inner causes.

**262. How can a spirit, who at its origin is simple, ignorant and inexperienced, consciously choose an existence and be responsible for its choices?**

At first, God guides the soul like a parent guides a young child. As the spirit grows, its freedom and responsibility increase.

> *When a spirit enjoys its free will, does the choice of its next corporeal existence always depend solely on its own volition, or can it be imposed on the spirit by God’s will as an expiation?*

Sometimes God allows or prescribes a particular incarnation when the spirit is not yet clear-sighted enough to choose well, or when a certain experience is necessary for its moral correction.

**263. Do spirits make their choice immediately after death?**

Not always.

Some are confused, afraid, or attached to beliefs about eternal punishment. This state itself can delay their willingness to choose. As clarity returns, they more consciously participate in planning their next life.

**264. What guides a spirit in choosing the trials it wants to bear?**

A desire to repair past harms, to purify the heart, and to advance more quickly.

Some choose poverty; others choose responsibility, power, or influence — each with its own risks and lessons.

**265. If some spirits choose contact with vice as a trial, are there others who choose it out of affinity and the desire to live in surroundings that cater to their tastes, or where they may give free rein to their materialistic tendencies?**

Yes. Less-evolved spirits sometimes seek environments that match their still-unhealed desires.

This prolongs their suffering, but eventually the emptiness and consequences of these choices lead them to seek purification.

**266. Wouldn’t it be natural for a spirit to choose the least painful trials possible?**

That seems natural to the incarnate mind, but not to the awakened spirit.

From the other side, the soul sees that temporary hardship can accelerate its journey toward lasting joy, much as a patient may accept unpleasant treatment to be cured.

**267. Can a spirit choose its next corporeal life during its present one?**

It can form intentions and desires that influence its future choices.

> *Don’t many individuals desire greatness and wealth, but not as an expiation or a trial?*

Yes, in the flesh we often seek comfort and glory. But the spirit, when lucid, may choose those same conditions as challenging tests rather than rewards.

**268. Until it reaches the state of perfect purity, does a spirit have to constantly undergo trials?**

Yes, but the nature of those trials changes.

At a certain point, they are no longer harsh experiences of suffering, but sacred responsibilities: guiding others, serving, and loving more perfectly.

**269. Can a spirit be mistaken as to the effectiveness of a trial it chooses?**

Yes. It may choose a test that is too difficult and fail, or a life that is too idle and gains little.

In either case, it will, later, ask for another chance to make better use of its opportunities.

**270. Why do persons have certain vocations or the desire to follow one career instead of another?**

These inclinations often echo past experiences and prepared abilities.

The soul brings forward tendencies, skills, and attractions developed in previous lives, which manifest as “natural talents” or strong callings.

**271. When a spirit in the errant state studies the conditions that will enable it to progress, how could it possibly imagine it could do so by being born among cannibals?**

Only spirits at a comparable level of development incarnate among very primitive groups. For them, this is progress; they are moving up from even more brutal conditions on other worlds.

**272. Can spirits who come from a world that is less evolved than earth or from a much less advanced people, such as cannibals, be born amongst civilized people?**

Yes. Some try to leap ahead too quickly and find themselves out of place.

They may struggle to adapt, and their behavior can reveal instincts not in harmony with the culture around them.

**273. Could a person belonging to a civilized culture reincarnate into a less advanced one as an expiation?**

Yes.

Those who abused privilege may be reborn in humbler or harsher conditions to experience what they once imposed on others. Conversely, advanced spirits may incarnate in less-evolved cultures on a mission to help them grow.

### **Relationships Beyond the Grave**

**274. Do the different orders of spirits establish a hierarchy of powers, and is there subordination and authority among them?**

Yes. There is real moral hierarchy in the spirit world.

> *Can low order spirits evade the authority of those who are more evolved?*

No. True spiritual authority flows from wisdom and love, and it exerts an irresistible influence.

**275. Do the power and influence that individuals enjoy on earth warrant them any supremacy in the spirit world?**

No. Earthly rank does not translate into spiritual rank.

> *How should we understand this exalting and abasing?*

“The lowly will be exalted and the great will be abased” means that inner character, not social status, determines the soul’s place. A servant may be spiritually far above a king.

**276. Don’t those who were great on earth but find themselves abased among the spirits feel humiliation?**

Yes, especially if they were proud.

Recognizing that their earthly greatness meant little in the realms of truth can be a painful but healing shock.

**277. After a battle, does a soldier who meets his general in the spirit world still acknowledge him as his superior?**

No, not based on rank alone.

Only moral greatness commands true respect in the spiritual realm.

**278. Are the spirits of different orders mixed together?**

They can encounter each other, but they naturally gravitate into groups by affinity — like attracts like. Good seeks good; selfishness seeks selfishness.

**279. Do all spirits have mutual access to one another?**

Good spirits can go anywhere, to help and guide.

Lower spirits, however, cannot enter the higher realms where selfishness and malice would disturb the harmony.

**280. What is the nature of the relationship between good and evil spirits?**

Good spirits work to soften, teach, and elevate those still trapped in wrongdoing. Their “authority” is service and love, not domination.

**281. Why do certain low order spirits take pleasure in inducing us to evil?**

Out of jealousy, resentment, and attachment to their own vices.

They are bitter that others might rise where they themselves still refuse to grow, and they try to drag others into the same darkness — until they themselves tire of suffering.

**282. How do spirits communicate with one another?**

They communicate thought to thought.

The universal spiritual “fluid” works like a vast medium for ideas, much as air carries sound for us — but more direct and subtle.

**283. Can spirits disguise their thoughts and hide themselves from each other?**

Not really among more advanced spirits.

Everything is transparent in the realm of clear conscience. Lower spirits may attempt to hide, and some can make themselves invisible to peers, but none can hide from those above them in purity.

**284. Since spirits no longer have a body, how can they establish their own individuality and make themselves recognizable to others around them?**

Through the perispirit — their subtle form.

It gives each spirit a distinct appearance and presence, much as the body does for us, though more flexible and expressive of inner reality.

**285. Do spirits recognize each other after having lived here on earth? Does the son recognize his father and the friend, her friend?**

Yes. Bonds of affection and shared history remain.

> *How do those who knew each other on earth recognize each other in the spirit world?*

The spirit has access to its life-story as if reading a book, and it sees who played which roles. Recognition is deep and intuitive.

**286. Upon leaving its mortal remains behind, does the soul immediately see the relatives and friends who had preceded it into the spirit world?**

Not always instantly.

There is often a period of confusion or adjustment. As clarity returns, loved ones become visible and accessible.

**287. How is the soul received upon its return to the spirit world?**

* A loving soul is welcomed like a beloved traveler returning home.
* A selfish or cruel soul may find itself among spirits of the same kind and experience isolation as a result of its own inner state.

**288. What sentiment do impure spirits experience at the sight of another evil spirit who has just arrived?**

They feel a kind of grim solidarity.

Just as people with corrupt habits might welcome someone like them, impure spirits feel a dark satisfaction in seeing another who shares their misery.

**289. Do our relatives and friends sometimes come to meet us when we leave the earth?**

Yes, often.

Those who love us come to help with the transition, to comfort us, and to assist in freeing us from the last ties of the body.

**290. Are relatives and friends always reunited after death?**

Not always immediately.

Reunion depends on spiritual harmony. If one progresses much faster than the other, they may live in different realms until their levels of purification are closer.

### **Sympathies and Antipathies Among Spirits. “Eternal Halves”**

**291. Besides a general sympathy that results from various similarities, are there special affections among spirits?**

Yes.

Spirits form deep, particular friendships and loves, even more true and lasting than earthly ones, because they are not disturbed by ego or material interest.

**292. Is there hatred among spirits?**

Yes, but only among impure spirits.

As spirits evolve, hatred falls away and is replaced by understanding and compassion.

**293. Will two beings who were enemies on earth retain their resentment in the spirit world?**

Usually, no.

When illusions fall away, they often see the triviality of their quarrels. But some imperfect spirits cling to resentment for a time, until they evolve.

**294. Is the remembrance of the wrongs that two individuals have committed against each other an obstacle to their sympathy?**

Yes, as long as pride and refusal to forgive persist.

Forgiveness dissolves the barrier and allows new forms of connection.

**295. What sentiment do those whom we have wronged in this world experience after death?**

If they are loving spirits, they forgive, especially when they see our sincere repentance.

If they are still bitter or undeveloped, they may hold onto resentment and even try to trouble us — but this is allowed only within the bounds of divine law and for our mutual learning.

**296. Are spirits’ personal affections susceptible to change?**

Yes.

As spirits evolve and illusions fall away, their loves become purer and more stable. Pure spirits love with a constancy we can barely imagine, because they see each other as they truly are.

**297. Does the affection that two beings had for each other on earth always continue in the spirit world?**

If the affection is rooted in genuine inner affinity, it continues and deepens.

If it rested mainly on physical attraction, convenience, or self-interest, it usually fades after death.

**298. Are souls who must get together predestined for such a union from their origin, and does each one of us have, in some part of the universe, “our other half”, whom we will someday inevitably join?**

No.

There is no rigid “one and only” soul made for another. Unity arises from shared growth and harmony, not from being created as halves of a single being.

**299. In what sense should we understand the term “other half”, which certain spirits use to designate sympathetic spirits?**

It’s a poetic image, not a literal doctrine.

It points toward deep spiritual affinity, but no spirit is incomplete or half-formed without another.

**300. When two perfectly sympathetic spirits are united, will they remain so throughout eternity, or can they separate and unite with other spirits?**

Among perfected spirits, there is no jealousy or exclusiveness.

They are united with all who share their level of love and light. Connections grow, they do not narrow.

**301. Are two sympathetic spirits each other’s complement or is such sympathy the result of perfect affinity?**

It is the result of affinity — harmony of character, aspiration, and purity.

Each spirit is whole in itself; the bond arises from resonance, not need.

**302. Does the affinity needed for perfect sympathy consist only in a similarity of thoughts and sentiments, or does it also consist in a uniformity of acquired knowledge?**

It depends primarily on their shared level of evolution.

Thoughts and feelings are similar because the souls have grown to comparable heights in wisdom and love.

**303. Could spirits who are not sympathetic today become more so later?**

Yes. All are destined to converge.

> *May two sympathetic spirits cease to be sympathetic?*

Only if one stagnates and the other continues to grow. As both advance toward greater love, harmony increases; if one refuses to progress, their paths separate until they are once again aligned.

### **The Remembrance of Corporeal Existence**

**304. Does the spirit remember its corporeal existence?**

Yes.

It recalls what it has been and often smiles — or grieves — at its former ignorance and follies, much as an adult smiles at the mistakes of childhood.

**305. Does the memory of its last corporeal existence completely and unexpectedly return to the spirit after death?**

Not usually all at once.

It comes back gradually, like images emerging from mist, especially as the spirit focuses on them and the confusion of death dissipates.

**306. Does the spirit remember all the events of its life in detail, assimilating the whole in one retrospective glance?**

It remembers what is morally and spiritually significant.

> *Could it remember them if it wanted to?*

Yes. It can recover even very small details if there is a reason to do so.

> *Does it see the purpose of its past earthly life in relation to its future life?*

More clearly than before. It sees how each choice has contributed to its growth — or delay — and understands more fully why purification is needed.

**307. How does its past life unfold in its memory? By an effort of the imagination, or like a picture it holds before its eyes?**

Both.

Events, choices, and inner states appear as if present, especially those that shaped its spiritual path. The spirit can revisit them almost as scenes, but with deeper understanding than before.

**308. Does the spirit remember all the lives that preceded the one it has just left behind?**

It can see the major movements — like stages of a long journey.

Early, primitive lives often fade into obscurity, but the overall thread of learning and repetition becomes clear.

**309. How does the spirit regard the body it has just left behind?**

Like clothing that no longer fits — sometimes with gratitude, often with relief.

> *What sentiment does it experience at the sight of its body decomposing?*

Usually indifference. It knows that its true self lives on, and the body is simply matter returning to matter.

**310. After a certain amount of time has elapsed, does the spirit recognize its bones or other things that had belonged to it?**

It can, especially if it still feels attached to earthly things. But the more evolved it is, the less importance it gives to material remnants.

**311. Does the respect we have for the material things that a spirit has left behind attract its attention to them, and does it regard such respect with pleasure?**

It is the *love and remembrance* behind the gesture that reaches the spirit, not the object itself.

The spirit is touched when it feels that it is remembered with affection.

**312. Do spirits hold on to the memory of the sufferings they bore during their last corporeal existence?**

Often, yes.

This memory actually helps them appreciate the peace and freedom of their current state — and sometimes strengthens their compassion for those still suffering on earth.

**313. Do humans who were happy on earth regret the pleasures they left behind?**

Lower spirits may feel nostalgic for earthly enjoyments.

But evolved spirits do not envy such pleasures; they have found a joy that far surpasses them.

**314. Do those who have begun great works intended for a useful purpose, but which they see interrupted by death, lament at having left them unfinished?**

They may feel some sadness at first, but they soon understand that others will continue the work. They often try to inspire those who follow after them.

**315. Do those who leave their works of art or literature behind retain the love they had for them during life?**

Sometimes, but their perspective changes.

Some see their works as childish or incomplete compared with what they now understand. Others simply care that the work helps and uplifts those who encounter it.

**316. Does the spirit still have an interest in the works that are being done on earth for the progress of the arts and sciences?**

Yes, to the degree that it is concerned with humanity’s progress.

Advanced spirits focus less on technical novelty and more on whether developments truly serve love, justice, and spiritual growth.

**317. After death, do spirits retain their love for their native land?**

Less-evolved spirits may cling to their country or region.

More advanced spirits see the entire universe as their homeland and feel closest to places where there is the greatest resonance with love and goodness.

**318. Do spirits’ ideas change in the spirit life?**

Yes, often profoundly.

As they detach from matter and see consequences more clearly, their opinions, values, and priorities shift toward what is more true and loving.

**319. Since the spirit had already lived the spirit life before its incarnation, why is it so astonished when it re-enters the spirit world?**

Because the transition is often clouded at first.

There is a period of confusion, like waking suddenly from a deep sleep. Once clarity returns, the spirit recognizes its true home and remembers that it has been there before.

### The Commemoration of the Dead. Funerals

**320. Are spirits sensitive to being remembered by those who loved them on earth?**

Very much so.

Being lovingly remembered brings them consolation, joy, and a sense of continued connection.

**321. Does Memorial Day hold a more solemn meaning for spirits? Do they prepare to visit those who will pray over their graves?**

Spirits are drawn by sincere thought and prayer, whether on special days or ordinary ones.

On days when many remember the departed, more spirits gather near, but each is concerned mainly with those who truly love them.

> *In what form do they come and what would they look like if they could make themselves visible?*

They would often appear in a form recognizable from their last life — familiar enough for loved ones to know them.

**322. Do forgotten spirits, whose graves are not visited by anyone, come despite that fact and feel troubled at not seeing any friends remembering them?**

Those who are still attached to the earth may feel some sadness.

But truly advanced spirits are no longer bound to a specific place. If no one on earth loves or remembers them, they turn their hearts toward God and the wider family of spirits.

**323. Does a visit made to its grave provide more satisfaction to a spirit than a prayer made on its behalf in someone’s home?**

Location is secondary.

What reaches the spirit is the *heart* and *intention*, whether at the graveside, in a church, or in a quiet corner at home.

**324. Do the spirits of individuals who are to be honored with statues or monuments attend the inaugurations and watch them with pleasure?**

Some do, when they can.

They are more deeply moved by the love and gratitude behind the honor than by the monument itself.

**325. Where does the desire come from where certain persons wish to be buried in one place rather than in another? Do they return to it with more satisfaction after death? And is the importance given to a physical thing a sign of a spirit’s impure nature?**

Such desires often reflect attachment to earthly identity and place.

More evolved spirits do not cling to burial sites; they know their true life is elsewhere.

> *Should gathering together the mortal remains of all the members of a family be considered meaningless?*

Not meaningless. It can be a beautiful expression of love and unity for the living, even if the spirits themselves are not “in” the tomb.

**326. Is a soul that has returned to life as a spirit sensitive to the honors paid to its mortal remains?**

Less-evolved spirits may take pride in such honors.

More advanced spirits see them as unimportant; they care more about whether people follow the good they tried to embody than whether their name is celebrated.

**327. Do spirits ever watch their own burial?**

Yes, often — especially in the early stages after death.

> *Do they feel flattered by a large gathering at their burial?*

Some do, if they still have vanity. Others are touched only by genuine love, not by ceremony or numbers.

**328. Does the spirit attend the meetings of its heirs?**

Very often.

It may witness the division of its estate. This can be instructive — and sometimes painful — as it sees the true motives and attachments of those left behind.

**329. Is the instinctive respect of people for the dead in all times and among all cultures the result of the intuition of a future existence?**

Yes.

Deep down, humanity senses that death is not the end, and that the departed still exist and deserve reverence. This instinct reflects our buried memory of the spirit world and our trust that life continues beyond the grave.
