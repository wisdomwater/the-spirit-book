## Chapter 10 — Occupations and Missions of Spirits

### Occupations and Missions of Spirits

**558. Do spirits have duties beyond their own personal growth?**

Yes. They take part in the harmony of the universe and carry out God’s intentions. Life in the spirit realm is always active, but never exhausting. Their work is not weighed down by physical fatigue or material need— it is a joyful, free participation in divine order.

**559. Do less evolved spirits also serve a useful purpose in the universe?**

They do. Every spirit has a task that contributes to the whole. Just as the simplest stonecutter contributes to a great building alongside the architect, all spirits—no matter their level—play their part.

**560. Does each spirit have special attributes?**

Every spirit must one day know all realms and all aspects of creation. Each will preside over different functions at different times— in this world, in other worlds, in the air, the water, and beyond. As Scripture says, *there is a time for everything.* Some are fulfilling their present roles here; others have done so before or will do so later.

**561. Are the roles spirits play permanent, belonging only to certain orders?**

No. All spirits rise through the degrees of growth and perfect themselves through effort. God gives no one unearned knowledge. Just as humans reach mastery of an art only after practicing its simplest forms, so do spirits learn by ascending step by step.

**562. Do highly advanced spirits, who have nothing left to learn, rest forever or remain active?**

Eternal idleness would be a form of suffering, not bliss.

> *What, then, are their occupations?*

They receive guidance from God, carry it throughout the universe, and oversee the unfolding of divine designs.

**563. Are the occupations of spirits continual?**

They are continual in the sense that a spirit’s thought is always active. Spirits live by thought. Yet their activity is nothing like human labor— it is a joy, because they know their work is meaningful.

> *Is this also true for less evolved spirits?*

They too have tasks that suit their nature and level. You would not assign the work of scholars to those still learning their first lessons.

**564. Are there spirits who are idle or who avoid useful work?**

Yes, but only for a time. Like humans who do not yet know what to do with their energy, underdeveloped spirits may linger in inactivity. But this idleness becomes heavy to them, and eventually the desire to progress awakens, pulling them back toward purposeful action.

In the beginning, spirits act more from instinct than conscious will, like newborn children learning to awaken to themselves.

**565. Do spirits examine our works of art and take interest in them?**

They notice anything that reveals the growth of the human spirit and the unfolding of intelligence and beauty.

**566. Does a spirit who practiced an art on earth still take interest in that art after death?**

Not in the way you might think. A spirit’s interests broaden as it evolves. What mattered in one lifetime may have been preceded by many other skills in previous lives. Highly advanced spirits know all arts and sciences in the course of their development.

What seems sublime to you may be only a child’s exercise compared to what exists in more refined worlds.

> *But what about less advanced spirits?*

Their view is more limited. They may still admire the very things that humans admire.

**567. Do spirits ever meddle in our occupations and pleasures?**

Every day. Especially the more common or less evolved spirits. They gather around human activity and often influence passions— sometimes exciting them, sometimes moderating them— for this too is part of how humanity grows.

Higher spirits observe earthly matters only when it contributes to progress. Lower spirits remain attached to what they remember from earthly life, and their interests reflect those memories.

**568. Do spirits fulfill their missions while incarnate or while wandering in the spirit state?**

Both. Some carry out important work as errant (discarnate) spirits, while others complete their mission while incarnated.

**569. What kinds of missions are given to errant spirits?**

They are countless, and many are beyond human understanding. Spirits carry out God’s will in ways too intricate and far-reaching for us to grasp.

Their missions always aim toward goodness— assisting the progress of individuals, families, nations, or entire eras. Some help prepare future events. Others comfort the sick, support the dying, encourage the sorrowful, or offer guidance through gentle suggestions and impressions.

A spirit advances by how faithfully it fulfills the task entrusted to it.

**570. Do spirits always understand the plan behind the missions they carry out?**

No. Some are like instruments used for a purpose they do not fully comprehend. Others understand clearly the meaning of what they do.

**571. Are only advanced spirits given missions?**

No. Missions match the spirit’s ability. Just as a courier carries a dispatch and a general leads an army, each serves according to capacity.

**572. Are missions imposed on spirits, or do they choose them?**

They request them— and rejoice when they are trusted with the work.

> *Can several spirits ask for the same mission?*
Yes, many may ask, but only some are chosen.

**573. What do the missions of incarnate spirits involve?**

Teaching, uplifting, healing, building, nurturing, inventing— all forms of helping humanity progress.

Missions vary widely in scope. One who cultivates the soil fulfills a mission just as surely as one who governs or instructs.

While incarnating for their own purification, spirits also serve the unfolding purposes of Providence. Every person has a mission, for everyone can be useful in some way.

**574. What of people who seem intentionally useless—who live only for themselves?**

They are to be pitied. They avoid usefulness now, but they will face the weariness of emptiness, and eventually they will long to redeem their wasted time.

> *Why would they choose such a life?*

Some spirits recoil from work and choose idleness. God allows it, knowing that experience will teach them its futility. Or they may have intended a useful life but abandoned it under the influence of spirits who encouraged laziness.

**575. Ordinary occupations seem like duties rather than missions. How can we recognize a true mission on earth?**

By the greatness of the good accomplished and the progress humanity receives through it.

**576. Are those with important missions predestined before birth? Do they know their mission?**

Sometimes. Often, they only sense it vaguely. After birth, circumstances shape the path and God leads them toward the work they must fulfill.

**577. When someone produces something useful, does that always mean they had a mission?**

Not always. Often, a discarnate spirit simply needed an instrument— a writer, a thinker, an artist—and found a receptive mind.

During sleep, the incarnate spirit may collaborate with the discarnate one to refine the work.

**578. Can a spirit fail in its mission?**

Yes—if it is not yet highly advanced.

> *What are the consequences?*

It must try again. This inner disappointment becomes its correction, and it also faces the effects of its failure on others.

**579. If God assigns missions, why entrust important work to someone who might fail?**

God knows the future. The divine plan does not depend on fragile instruments for what truly must unfold. Spirit missions fit perfectly into God’s foresight— even when humans cannot see how.

**580. Does a spirit sent on a mission feel the same apprehension as one incarnating for a trial?**

No. Experience gives confidence.

**581. What about geniuses who should enlighten humanity but instead teach error or half-truths?**

They have fallen short of their task. Still, teachings must fit their time— what seems childish today may have been a needed step long ago.

**582. Is parenthood a mission?**

Without question. It is a profound duty and sacred trust. Children are placed in our care so we may guide their hearts toward goodness.

Some nurture their orchards better than their children— forgetting that a neglected soul brings deeper consequences than neglected soil.

If parents fail through indifference, they will answer for the suffering that results, for they did not support their children’s growth toward the good.

**583. If a child goes astray despite the parents’ efforts, are the parents responsible?**

No. The task is heavier when the child has strong inclinations toward wrongdoing, and success brings greater merit.

> *If a child becomes good despite negligent parents, do the parents benefit?*

God is just.

**584. What missions belong to conquerors who pursue ambition without regard for the suffering they cause?**

Most often, they are unwitting instruments of God, helping humanity advance through upheaval.

> *If they caused suffering for selfish reasons,
do they still benefit from the good that results?*

No. Each is rewarded according to intention and integrity.

### Summary

Spirits have many tasks—some humble, some vast. Incarnate spirits work within the limits of the body. Discarnate spirits work according to their growth: some travel between worlds, some inspire thoughts and guide events, some nurture individuals and communities, some preside over the forces of nature, and some, still imperfect, wait in longing to rise.

All move toward the same goal: to participate in the unfolding of God’s goodness, each according to their degree of light.
