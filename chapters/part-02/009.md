## Chapter 9 — The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World

### The Reading of Our Thoughts by Spirits

**456. Can spirits see everything we do?**

Spirits surround us constantly, and thus they can see our actions.
But they notice only what draws their attention—what matters to them.
They do not waste time on what does not concern or interest them.

**457. Can spirits know even our most secret thoughts?**

Often, yes. They may see clearly what we barely admit to ourselves.
Thoughts and intentions are transparent to them.

* *So is it easier to hide something from the living than from those who have died?*

Certainly. When you believe yourself most hidden, many spirits may be quietly watching.

**458. What do the spirits who observe us think of us?**

It depends on who they are.
Frivolous spirits may mock our impatience or enjoy the small troubles they provoke.
Serious and loving spirits, however, feel compassion for our faults and try to guide us gently toward growth.

### The Concealed Influence of Spirits on Our Thoughts and Actions

**459. Do spirits influence our thoughts and actions?**

More than you imagine. Often they whisper the very ideas we follow.

**460. Do we have our own thoughts plus others suggested by spirits?**

Yes. Your soul thinks naturally on its own.
But you may notice that multiple thoughts—sometimes contradictory—appear at once.
This is the mixture: what arises from within, and what is quietly suggested from beyond.

**461. How can we distinguish between our own thoughts and those suggested to us?**

A suggested thought may feel like a voice or a nudge not entirely your own.
Your own thoughts tend to be the first, natural impulse.

Yet do not become overly concerned about separating them.
The important responsibility is choosing well.
If you choose what is good, you act with freedom;
if you choose poorly, the accountability deepens.

**462. Do intelligent or gifted people draw all their ideas from their own minds?**

Sometimes.
But often, higher spirits inspire them—trusting them to understand and share those ideas.
When thinkers search for inspiration, they are unknowingly calling to the spirit world.

*If it were important to distinguish our thoughts from those suggested, God would have made that clear.
Some vagueness protects us and keeps us truly free.*

**463. Is the first impulse always the best one?**

It depends on the spirit within the person.
For those who listen to good inspirations, the first impulse often aligns with goodness.

**464. How can we tell if a suggested thought comes from a good spirit or an unkind one?**

Reflect upon it.
Good spirits give counsel that is loving, peaceful, elevating, and wise.
Harmful spirits sow discord, fear, pride, and selfish desire.
Discernment is your work.

**465. For what purpose do imperfect spirits encourage us toward harm?**

Because misery seeks company.
They suffer from being far from God’s light, and envy stirs them.

* *Does misleading others reduce their suffering?*

No. But their bitterness drives them anyway.

* *What do they want us to suffer?*

The pains that come from moral distance—from choosing against love.

**466. Why does God permit these spirits to incite evil?**

They become instruments of growth.
Life on earth is a school for the soul, and every temptation reveals our true inclinations.
Evil influences match the desires we already entertain—
they cannot sway us unless we welcome them inwardly.

You always remain free.
Good spirits also counsel you, balancing the scales.

---

**467. Can we avoid the influence of spirits who try to lead us astray?**

Yes. They attach themselves only to those who invite them by desire or thought.

**468. Do such spirits eventually give up if resisted?**

They leave when there is nothing for them to do—
yet they watch for moments of weakness, like a cat watching a mouse.

**469. How can we neutralize the influence of harmful spirits?**

By doing good.
By trusting God.
By refusing to entertain the thoughts they suggest—especially thoughts of pride, discord, and cruelty.

This is why Jesus taught us to pray,
*“Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”*

**470. Do spirits who tempt us receive a mission from God? Will they be held accountable?**

No spirit is sent by God to do harm.
When they do so, it is of their own will, and they bear the consequences.
God may permit the trial—but never commands the wrongdoing.

**471. What about sudden waves of anxiety or peace—without any clear cause?**

Such feelings are often the subtle brush of spirit communication,
either in waking life or remembered faintly from dreams.

**472. Can spirits create circumstances of temptation, or only take advantage of existing ones?**

They may gently arrange circumstances—suggesting a direction,
a thought, a moment—
but the choice remains yours.
A person may find money on the road; whether to keep it or return it arises from the spirits who whisper on both sides—and from one’s own conscience.

### The Possessed

**473. Can a spirit take over someone’s body and replace the incarnate spirit?**

No. A spirit cannot enter the body as one enters a house.
But it may strongly influence an incarnate spirit whose faults mirror its own.
Still, the incarnate spirit remains the one acting through the body.

**474. If two spirits cannot inhabit the same body, can one spirit overpower another to the point of subjugation?**

Yes.
This is true “possession”: a surrender of will, invited by weakness or desire.

Note: many who were once called “possessed” were simply ill and needed a doctor, not an exorcist.

**475. Can such domination be broken by the person themselves?**

Yes. Strong will and intention break the bond.

**476. Can someone be unaware they are subjugated? Can another person help free them?**

A morally upright person may help by inviting good spirits and reinforcing the will of the afflicted.
But no one can be freed unless they themselves choose freedom.
Some, sadly, cling to the very influences that bind them.

Purity of heart is essential—
good spirits do not work through those who lack integrity.

**477. Are traditional exorcism formulas effective?**

No. Harmful spirits laugh at them.
They persist unless the person resists inwardly.

**478. What should someone obsessed by an unkind spirit do?**

Ignore the spirit’s suggestions.
Offer no reaction.
Patience and indifference starve their influence.

**479. Is prayer effective against obsession?**

Yes—when prayer is joined to action and inner change.
Prayer alone is not enough; God helps those who cooperate with grace.

**480. What should we think of Jesus “casting out demons” in the Gospels?**

Understand “demon” as an intrusive or harmful spirit, or even as an illness interpreted spiritually.
To remove such influence—whether by healing the body or correcting the mind—is to “cast it out.”
Many teachings appear strange only when taken literally instead of as spiritual metaphors.

### Convulsionaries

**481. Do spirits contribute to the strange phenomena among “convulsionaries”?**

Yes—along with strong magnetic forces.
But exaggeration and deceit have often distorted the truth.

* *What kinds of spirits participate?*
  Generally, less evolved spirits who find amusement in such disturbances.

**482. How can such states spread rapidly among groups?**

Through emotional and energetic sympathy.
Spirits act upon these heightened states, amplifying what is already present.

**483. What causes the physical insensitivity shown by convulsionaries and others under extreme strain?**

Sometimes a magnetic effect on the nervous system.
Sometimes the spirit is so absorbed that the body no longer registers pain.
Intense focus can silence the senses.

### The Affection of Certain Spirits for Certain Persons

**484. Do spirits lovingly prefer certain individuals?**

Yes.
Good spirits draw near to those who seek goodness.
Lower spirits cling to those who echo their own tendencies.

**485. Is such affection purely spiritual?**

True affection is free from the physical,
yet spirits may be drawn by lingering earthly attachments as well.

**486. Do spirits care about our joys and sorrows?**

Good spirits rejoice when we grow and share our joys as blessings.
They feel concern when suffering does not soften or uplift us.

**487. What kinds of afflictions concern them most?**

Our selfishness, pride, and hardness of heart.
Physical troubles matter little compared to the moral wounds that keep us from spiritual maturity.

**488. Do departed loved ones still care for us?**

Yes. Their affection often deepens.
They are sensitive to our love—and saddened when forgotten.

### Guardian Angels: Protector, Familiar, and Sympathetic Spirits

**489. Are there spirits who watch over and protect individuals?**

Yes. These are our guardian or protector spirits.

**490. What is a guardian angel?**

A high and loving spirit entrusted with guiding us.

**491. What is their mission?**

Like wise parents, they guide, comfort, counsel, and strengthen us through life’s trials.

**492. Are they with us from birth?**

Yes—from birth to death, and often across many lifetimes.

**493. Is this mission voluntary?**

They accept it willingly, though it carries responsibility and commitment.

* *Can a spirit protect more than one person?*
  Yes, but with different degrees of attention.

**494. Can a guardian spirit leave its post?**

Temporarily, yes—when called to other work.
But a replacement will be sent.

**495. Do they abandon us if we ignore their guidance?**

They may withdraw when their voice is rejected—
yet they never fully leave.
They return as soon as we turn toward them again.

A beautiful teaching follows:
to know that at every moment a loving, wiser spirit walks beside us is one of the most consoling truths of existence.
We are never alone—not in sorrow, not in confinement, not even in our darkest wanderings.

**496. If good spirits withdraw, do they ever do us harm?**

Never.
They simply give space for other influences we ourselves have welcomed.

**497. Can our protectors let harmful spirits approach us?**

Yes—when it offers us needed growth.
But they always return when invoked.

**498. Why do protector spirits sometimes allow us to stray?**

Because struggle strengthens us.
They whisper counsel, but if pride or weakness wins, they allow the lesson to unfold.

**499. Are protectors with us constantly?**

They are present as needed.
At times, their direct involvement would hinder our freedom.

**500. Will we ever no longer need a guardian?**

Only when we have matured enough to guide ourselves.
This does not generally happen during earthly life.

**501. Why is their help so concealed?**

If we leaned visibly on them, we would not grow.
They guard our freedom and responsibility.

**502. Do guardian spirits gain anything from our progress?**

Yes.
Our growth brings them joy and contributes to their own advancement.

* *Are they responsible if their ward fails?*
  No. They offer all they can.

**503. Do they suffer when we fail morally?**

They grieve, but without despair—
knowing healing is always possible and time belongs to God.

**504. Can we know our guardian’s name?**

Names matter little in the spirit world.
You may invoke your guardian by any name that inspires reverence.

**505. If a spirit uses a well-known name, is it truly that spirit?**

Not always.
But spirits act on behalf of those they admire, just as ambassadors speak for their sovereign.

**506. Will we recognize our guardian after death?**

Yes.
Often, we knew them before this life began.

**507. Can a parent become a child’s guardian spirit?**

Sometimes—but guardian duty requires spiritual maturity.
A parent may help, supported by a more advanced spirit.

**508. Can recently departed loved ones protect us?**

Yes, but their power varies with their spiritual condition.

**509. Do morally undeveloped people also have protector spirits?**

Everyone does—
but the spirit assigned is appropriate to the person’s level and needs.

**510. What happens when a protector reincarnates?**

Another sympathetic spirit temporarily assists.
No one is left without support.

**511. Is an evil spirit assigned to each person?**

Not assigned, but attracted.
Evil spirits attach themselves when welcomed by desire or weakness.

**512. Can we have several protector or sympathetic spirits?**

Yes—spirits of varying closeness and purpose may accompany us.

**513. Does a sympathetic spirit serve a mission?**

Sometimes.
Often the bond forms simply through shared affinity.

**514. Are familiar spirits the same as guardian angels?**

No.
Familiar spirits are friendly companions—sometimes lighthearted, sometimes limited.
Guardian spirits are wiser, more elevated, and devoted to our growth.

### Presentiments

**522. Are presentiments warnings from our guardian spirit?**

Often, yes.
But they may also arise from deep spiritual memory—
impressions of the life plan we chose before birth.

**523. What should we do when a presentiment feels vague?**

Pray.
Ask God and your protector spirit for clarity and peace.

**524. Do guardian spirits care about the practical details of our lives as well as our moral choices?**

Yes.
They care for all that shapes our well-being—
but we often ignore their gentle guidance.

### The Influence of Spirits on the Events of Life

**525. Do spirits influence life events?**

Yes—through counsel, intuition, and subtle guidance.
Not through miracles, but through natural means.

**526. Can spirits cause physical events to fulfill a destined outcome?**

They do not break natural laws.
If something is meant to occur, spirits guide the person into the circumstance where natural causes unfold.

**527. Does the same apply to lightning, accidents, or sudden events?**

Yes.
The event follows natural law;
the inspiration to be in that place at that time comes from the spirit realm.

**528. Can spirits protect us from harm—like deflecting a bullet?**

Not by altering nature, but by inspiring movement, hesitation, or confusion in the assailant.

**529. What about “magic bullets” of legend?**

Pure fiction.
Humans love the fantastic more than the simple workings of nature.

**530. Do mischievous spirits cause daily annoyances?**

Sometimes.
They enjoy our impatience.
But many troubles come simply from our own inattention.

* *Do they act from personal hostility or simple mischief?*
  Either.
  Some follow old grudges; others seek amusement.

**531. Does hatred persist after death?**

Sometimes.
A spirit may continue hostility until it awakens to wisdom.

* *How can we end such hostility?*
  By praying for them
  and repaying harm with goodness.
  Resistance without resentment eventually dissolves their power.

**532. Can spirits avert misfortune or bring prosperity?**

Not by overriding destiny.
But they can strengthen our patience, sharpen our judgment, and inspire wise choices.

What seems misfortune may become blessing;
what seems blessing may mislead.
The present moment does not reveal the whole story.

**533. Can spirits grant fortune if asked?**

Rarely—and often as a test.
Usually such gifts are offered by mischievous spirits seeking influence.

**534. When plans fall apart, is it due to spirits?**

Sometimes—but often it is simply our own misjudgment.
We can become our own “evil spirit” when we persist down an unsuitable path.

**535. When good things happen, should we thank our guardian spirit?**

Yes—but first thank God.
Spirits are God’s helpers.

* *What if we forget?*
  It reveals ingratitude, which harms us more than them.

### The Action of Spirits on the Phenomena of Nature

**536. Do natural disasters have a providential purpose?**

Everything unfolds under God’s permission.
Some events relate to humanity; others restore balance within nature.

**537. Did ancient myths of gods controlling wind, storms, and crops contain any truth?**

Not as literal beings—
but as intuitive ways of expressing the work of unseen spiritual forces.

**538. Are nature-spirits a distinct category?**

They are simply spirits—some more advanced, some less—
who fulfill certain roles in the harmony of creation.

**539. Do they work alone or in groups?**

In vast multitudes.

**540. Do they act consciously or instinctively?**

Both.
Some act with intention; others act like nature’s laborers—unaware they serve a divine design.
Every being, from the smallest particle to the most radiant spirit, participates in God’s unfolding harmony.

### Spirits during Battle

**541. Do spirits assist during battle?**

Yes—strengthening courage on both sides.

**542. Why would spirits support an unjust cause?**

Lower spirits seek disorder and destruction; they care little for justice.

**543. Can spirits inspire military leaders?**

Yes—just as they inspire thinkers and artists.

**544. Can harmful spirits mislead leaders?**

Yes.
But leaders remain responsible for their choices.

**545. Do great commanders act through a type of intuitive foresight?**

Often.
Their genius is supported by spirits who guide them.

**546. What happens to the spirits of those who die suddenly in battle?**

They are stunned at first, feeling as if still engaged in the fight.
Gradually, clarity returns.

**547. Do enemies remain enemies after death?**

Initially they may, but such hostility fades as they awaken to spiritual truth.

* *Do they still hear the sounds of battle?*
  Yes, for a time.

**548. Do observing spirits witness the separation of soul and body?**

Yes.
Most deaths are gradual.
The spirit shifts out of the body naturally, and other spirits see this transition without distress.

### Pacts

**549. Do people form pacts with evil spirits?**

Not in the literal sense.
But when a person intentionally aligns with harmful intentions,
spirits of the same nature gather around them.

**550. What about legends of selling one’s soul?**

These stories capture a moral truth:
when we choose selfishness or cruelty for worldly gain,
we bind ourselves to spirits who share those desires.
Yet these bonds can always be broken through repentance and the help of good spirits.

### Occult Power, Talismans, Sorcerers

**551. Can evil people, aided by evil spirits, truly harm others?**

God does not permit such power.

**552. Can someone “cast a spell”?**

People with strong magnetic influence may affect others—
but not through magical power, only through natural forces.
Superstition often exaggerates what it does not understand.

**553. What about rituals meant to command spirits?**

They have no real power.
Spirits respond to thought, intention, and moral character—never to formulas or objects.

* *Do spirits ever dictate strange rituals?*
  Only mocking spirits, who enjoy deceiving the gullible.

**554. Can belief in a talisman attract a spirit?**

The object itself has no power,
but the intention behind it may call certain spirits—
usually light-minded or deceptive ones, since superstition narrows the mind.

**555. What are “sorcerers”?**

Often people with natural magnetism or intuition.
Their abilities are misunderstood as supernatural.

Understanding magnetism and spiritual influence dissolves superstition
and reveals the simple truth beneath exaggerated stories.

**556. Do some people truly heal through touch?**

Yes—when magnetic vitality is joined with pure intention and love.
Good spirits assist such work.
But discernment is needed, for many tales of miracle-working are distorted or exploited.

### Blessings and Curses

**557. Can blessings or curses bring good or harm?**

Words have influence—
but only within God’s permission.

Unjust curses fall back on the one who utters them.
Blessings uplift when they align with goodness.

Neither can override divine justice.
