## CHAPTER I — Spirits

### The Origin and Nature of Spirits

**76. How can we define spirits?**

Spirits are the intelligent beings of creation.
They are the conscious, thinking inhabitants of the universe beyond the material world.

**77. Are spirits parts or emanations of God, or are they distinct from God?**

Spirits come from God, but they are not God.
Just as a person may build a beautiful machine and call it their “creation,” the machine is their work but not their own being. In the same way, we are God’s children because we come from the Divine, but we are not fragments of the Divine Essence itself.

**78. Did spirits have a beginning, or have they existed eternally like God?**

If spirits had no beginning, they would be equal to God. Instead, they are created beings, dependent on God’s will.
God alone is without beginning. We do not know the exact “moment” or manner of our own creation. It is enough to say: God is eternal, and from that eternal Source spirits are continually brought into being. The details of how and when each of us began remain a holy mystery.

**79. Since there are two great elements in the universe — the intelligent and the material — are spirits formed from the intelligent element, while bodies are formed from the material element?**

Yes. Spirits are individualizations of the intelligent principle, just as bodies are individualizations of the material principle.
How, exactly, this individualization takes place is still beyond our understanding.

**80. Is the creation of spirits something that only happened in the distant past, or is it ongoing?**

It is ongoing. God has never stopped creating spirits.

**81. Do spirits arise from one another, or are they each directly created by God?**

Like all creation, spirits come from the will of God.
But the precise details of their origin remain hidden from us.

**82. Is it correct to say that spirits are immaterial?**

Your language struggles here. “Immaterial” can suggest “nothing,” which is misleading. A better term would be “incorporeal” — without a physical body like yours.
Spirits are not made of the same kind of matter you know. They consist of a refined, subtle essence we might describe as “quintessentialized matter.” It is so delicate and ethereal that your senses cannot perceive it.

We call spirits “immaterial” to express that they are of a completely different nature than the matter we can touch. Just as a person born blind cannot imagine light, we have no direct sensory comparison for the essence of spirits. Our attempts to describe them are always partial and symbolic.

**83. Do spirits have an end? If they had a beginning, must they also one day cease to exist?**

There are many things your present mind cannot fully grasp, and this should not lead you to reject them.
What we can affirm is this: the individuality of spirits does not come to an end. They do not dissolve back into an anonymous mass. Their personal existence continues without being extinguished.

### The Primitive, Normal World

**84. Do spirits form a world of their own beyond the visible one?**

Yes. There is a world of spirits — a realm of incorporeal intelligences.

**85. Which is primary: the spiritual world or the material world?**

The spiritual world is primary.
It existed before the material world and will remain after the material world has changed and passed away.

**86. Could the material world cease to exist without changing the essence of the spiritual world?**

Yes. The two are distinct.
And yet they are deeply related, constantly interacting and influencing each other.

**87. Do spirits live in a limited “place,” confined to a specific region of space?**

Spirits are everywhere. They fill the immensity of space in unimaginable numbers.

Many stand beside you, watch over you, or influence you without your knowing it. They are one of the forces through which God guides creation and carries out Divine purposes.

Not all spirits can go everywhere, however. Some regions or conditions are closed to those who have not yet grown enough in wisdom and purity.

---

### The Form and Ubiquity of Spirits

**88. Do spirits have a definite and constant form?**

Not in the way you see forms. To you, they have no fixed outline.
To spirits, however, they may appear like a flame, a light, or a subtle spark.

— *Does this flame or spark have color?*

From your perspective, it may appear anywhere from a dull red glow to a brilliant radiance, depending on the spirit’s degree of purity.

This is why spiritual beings are sometimes depicted with a flame or star on their forehead. It is a symbol of consciousness and intelligence — the inner light of the mind.

**89. Do spirits take time to cross space?**

Yes, but their movement is as swift as thought.

— *Isn’t thought itself the soul moving from place to place?*

Where your thought truly is, you are, because thought is one of the soul’s essential expressions.

**90. When a spirit travels, is it aware of the distance it crosses, or does it simply find itself at its destination?**

Both experiences are possible.
A spirit may be keenly aware of the distance traveled or feel as if distance has vanished. It depends on its will and its level of refinement.

**91. Is matter an obstacle to spirits?**

No. They can move through air, water, earth, and even fire.
Matter, as you know it, does not block them.

**92. Do spirits possess ubiquity? Can a single spirit be truly present in many places at once?**

A spirit is not divided into pieces.
But each spirit is like a radiant center whose influence and thought can extend in many directions at the same time, giving the impression of being in several places at once.

Think of the sun: it is one body, yet its light reaches countless points in space. It does not divide itself, yet it is perceived everywhere its rays shine.

— *Do all spirits radiate with the same power?*

No. Their radiance depends on their inner purity and development.

Spirits are indivisible, but their thought can be present in many directions at once. This is what we mean by a kind of “ubiquity”: not a splitting of their being, but a wide and simultaneous presence through consciousness and influence.

---

### The Perispirit

**93. Is a spirit completely without any covering, or is it clothed in some subtle substance?**

A spirit is surrounded by a fine, semi-material envelope — delicate to you, yet still substantial to spirits.
It is light enough to move freely and rise into the regions it wishes to visit.

Just as a seed is wrapped in a protective skin, the spirit is wrapped in a kind of spiritual body we call the **perispirit**.

**94. Where does the perispirit come from?**

It is drawn from the “universal fluid” of each world.
Because of this, the nature of the perispirit differs from world to world. When a spirit moves from one world to another, it “changes garments,” so to speak, taking on a new envelope suited to that realm.

— *So when spirits come from more advanced worlds to ours, do they take on a denser perispirit?*

Yes. They must clothe themselves in a form compatible with the conditions of this world, as we have said.

**95. Does this semi-material envelope have a specific form, and can it be seen?**

Yes. It can take on a form according to the spirit’s intention.
This is how spirits may appear in dreams or even in waking life — sometimes becoming visible or, in rare circumstances, even tangible.

---

### The Different Orders of Spirits

**96. Are all spirits equal, or is there a hierarchy among them?**

There is a hierarchy.
Spirits differ according to their degree of inner purification, wisdom, and love.

**97. Is there a fixed number of spiritual orders or levels?**

There is no rigid, fixed number, because growth is gradual.
You can draw more or fewer lines between stages, just as you can group colors in different ways along a rainbow. Still, looking at their general traits, we can speak of three main orders:

1. **First order** — Pure spirits, who have reached spiritual perfection.
2. **Second order** — Good spirits, whose main aim is to do good, though they still have trials to complete.
3. **Third order** — Imperfect spirits, marked by ignorance, selfishness, and lower passions that slow their progress.

---

### The Spirit Hierarchy (Overview)

**100. A note on classification.**

The classification of spirits is based on their growth, on the qualities they have acquired, and on the imperfections they still carry.

It is not absolute, but a way of understanding a vast range of spiritual maturity. Just as in nature there are subtle transitions between species and forms, so too in the spiritual world there are gradual steps rather than sharp borders.

Spirits themselves generally recognize three great groups:

* **Imperfect spirits** — where material tendencies still dominate.
* **Good spirits** — where spiritual motives are stronger than material ones.
* **Pure spirits** — who have reached the fullness of spiritual development.

This framework helps us discern the tone and trustworthiness of spiritual communications. It explains why some messages are wise and loving, and others are confused, prideful, or misleading.

---

### Third Order — Imperfect Spirits

**101. General characteristics**

In these spirits, material tendencies outweigh spiritual ones. They may show:

* Ignorance
* Pride
* Selfishness
* Harmful passions

They sense that God exists, but do not truly understand God.
Not all are deeply evil; some are simply shallow, foolish, or indifferent. But there are those who deliberately choose harm, delighting in it and in the suffering it causes.

Though some of them possess high intelligence, their thoughts lack true elevation and compassion. They remember their past suffering and the pain they have caused, and this memory can torment them. Because they cannot see the end of their trials, they sometimes imagine themselves condemned forever — a belief that is itself part of their purification.

They are divided into several groups:

**102. Tenth class — Impure Spirits**

These are strongly inclined to evil and often make it their main concern. They:

* Give dangerous counsel
* Encourage division, hostility, and distrust
* Enjoy dragging others down and obstructing their progress

Their language is often coarse, cruel, and vulgar. Even when they imitate serious or “wise” speech, they eventually reveal their true nature.

In earthly life, they gravitate toward vices such as cruelty, deceit, greed, hypocrisy, and uncontrolled sensuality. They do harm for the pleasure of harming, often targeting those who strive to live honestly. They are the true scourges of humanity whenever they choose to act and influence.

**103. Ninth class — Frivolous Spirits**

These are ignorant, playful, and mocking. They:

* Interfere in everything
* Answer questions without caring about truth
* Love pranks, confusion, and petty disturbances

They may be witty or amusing, but they lack depth and seriousness. Many popular images of “imps” or “pixies” reflect this category.

**104. Eighth class — Pseudo-Learned Spirits**

These spirits know quite a bit, but think they know everything. They:

* Speak in a serious and authoritative tone
* Mix truth with personal misconceptions and old prejudices
* Are still marked by pride, stubbornness, and vanity

They can be persuasive, but their teachings must be weighed carefully.

**105. Seventh class — Neutral Spirits**

They are neither notably good nor notably bad. They:

* Drift between better and worse tendencies
* Remain attached to material interests
* Show no clear moral aspiration toward higher goodness

**106. Sixth class — Boisterous and Disturbing Spirits**
These are spirits, often of the third order, who:

* Manifest through noises, knocking, movements of objects, and other physical phenomena
* Seem especially tied to dense matter and natural forces
* Can affect the elements — air, water, fire, earth — under certain conditions

Higher spirits may occasionally employ them to produce physical signs when these are useful, but they themselves tend to act in a crude and disorderly way.

---

### Second Order — Good Spirits

**107. General characteristics**

In these spirits, the spiritual nature is stronger than material impulses. Their central desire is to do good.

They may differ in how much they know or how pure they are, but generally they:

* Understand God and the larger spiritual order
* Find joy in helping, healing, and guiding
* Are freed from the envy, hatred, and bitterness that torment lower spirits

They still have trials to pass, but they live with a deep inner peace and unity with one another.

When they communicate with humans, they:

* Encourage good thoughts and actions
* Warn us away from harmful choices
* Help protect and inspire those who are sincere in their efforts

When incarnate, they:

* Are kind, benevolent, and generous
* Do good for its own sake
* Resist pride, selfishness, and jealousy

We can further distinguish:

**108. Fifth class — Benevolent Spirits**

Their defining trait is kindness. They love to serve, protect, and comfort, though their knowledge may be limited. Their strength lies more in the heart than in the intellect.

**109. Fourth class — Learned Spirits**

These spirits possess wide knowledge, especially in scientific or intellectual matters.
They value knowledge as a tool for good, not for vanity, and they are free from the coarse passions of lower spirits.

**110. Third class — Wise Spirits**

They unite moral nobility with sound judgment.
Even if they do not know everything, they have a deep sense of what is right and measured, and they understand people and situations with clarity.

**111. Second class — High Order Spirits**
These spirits combine:

* Knowledge
* Wisdom
* Goodness

Their words are marked by dignity, kindness, and often a deep, elevating beauty. Within the limits of what we are allowed to know, they are excellent teachers of spiritual realities.

They willingly communicate with those who sincerely seek truth and strive to live beyond narrow selfishness. They are less available to those searching only for entertainment or sensation.

When they incarnate on earth, it is usually to fulfill important missions of progress — to show, in human form, what moral and spiritual maturity can look like.

---

### First Order — Pure Spirits

**112. General characteristics**

These spirits are no longer influenced by matter.
They possess complete moral and intellectual superiority in relation to other spirits.

**113. First and only class — Pure Spirits**

They have passed through every stage of growth and are fully purified. They:

* No longer need trials or expiations
* Are free from reincarnation in perishable bodies
* Live in deep, unshakable joy in the presence of God

Their happiness is not passive idleness. They:

* Act as messengers and ministers of God
* Maintain harmony in the universe
* Guide and support spirits of lower orders
* Inspire humans toward good and help us repair the wrongs we have done

They are sometimes called angels, archangels, or seraphim.
We may communicate with them, but it is a mistake — and a subtle form of pride — to imagine that such exalted spirits are constantly at anyone’s personal beck and call.

---

### The Progression of Spirits

**114. Are spirits born good or evil, or can they change?**

They can grow and change.
As they do, they rise from lower levels to higher ones.

**115. Did God create some spirits good and others evil?**

No. God created all spirits simple and without knowledge — like children at the beginning of a long journey.

Each spirit is given a mission: to learn, to grow, and to move toward perfection through experience and contact with truth. As they advance, they draw closer to God and to lasting happiness.

Some accept their trials with humility and progress more quickly. Others resist, complain, or rebel and thus delay their own joy — but the path remains open.

**116. Are there spirits who will remain forever in the lower orders?**

No. All spirits are destined for perfection. They may advance slowly, but none are excluded. A truly just and loving God would not banish any child forever.

**117. Do spirits themselves determine how quickly they progress?**

Yes. Their pace depends on their willingness, their openness to the Good, and their cooperation with Divine guidance — just as a willing student learns more quickly than one who resists.

**118. Can spirits regress?**

No. Once they gain real understanding, they do not lose it.
They may stop progressing for a time, or delay themselves, but they do not fall back to a previous level of ignorance.

**119. Could God have created spirits already perfect, without trials?**

God could have, but then they would have had no merit in their perfection.
Struggle and choice are the way their individuality and character are formed. Differences in growth also allow each to fulfill different roles in the great harmony of the universe.

**120. Must all spirits experience evil in order to reach goodness?**

Not evil, but ignorance.
They begin without knowledge and must awaken to truth and love.

**121. Why do some spirits follow the good path and others choose evil?**

Because they have free will.
God does not create anyone destined for evil. Spirits begin capable of both good and evil. Those who choose evil do so by their own decision.

**122. At their beginning, how can spirits choose between good and evil if they are still ignorant?**

Free will unfolds as the spirit gains awareness. Influences from outside — especially from imperfect spirits — present temptations. Through freedom, each spirit chooses whether to yield or to resist.

This is what is symbolized in stories of “the fall” and “original sin”: some spirits give in to harmful influences, others resist and grow stronger.

These influences continue as long as the spirit remains vulnerable to them. As it gains self-mastery and clarity, it becomes less affected by such temptations.

**123. Why does God allow spirits to choose the path of evil at all?**

Because freedom is part of God’s wisdom.
Without real choice, there is no real love, no real merit. The dignity of the spirit is found precisely in being able to choose the good willingly.

**124. Are there only spirits who choose pure good and pure evil, or are there many levels in between?**

There are many gradations.
Most spirits travel paths that are mixed — not wholly good, not wholly bad, but somewhere in between, learning and unlearning along the way.

**125. Can spirits who have chosen evil eventually reach the same height as those who have always followed the good?**

Yes. But for them, the journey feels much longer. They perceive their suffering as “eternities” because they cannot yet see its end.

**126. Are spirits who have gone through evil less loved by God when they finally reach the highest level?**

No. God loves all equally. Those who are now called “evil” are simply spirits who have stumbled and misused their freedom. Before they fell, they were just simple, inexperienced spirits, like all others.

---

### Angels and Demons

**128. Are angels, archangels, and seraphim a special class of beings different in nature from other spirits?**

No. They are pure spirits — those who have reached the highest stage of development and inner perfection.

**129. Have angels also gone through all the degrees of growth?**

Yes. They too have had their trials and stages. Some accepted their mission and lessons willingly and advanced quickly; others took more time.

**130. If no spirit was created perfect from the start, why do many traditions speak of beings who have always been perfect?**

Because your world is not eternal. Long before it existed, there were already spirits who had reached great heights.
From the human point of view, they appear as if they had always been perfect.

**131. Are there demons, in the usual sense of the word: beings created specifically to do evil forever?**

No. If such beings existed, they would still be God’s creatures. Would a just and good God create souls doomed to evil and eternal misery?

The “demons” you imagine are, in truth, imperfect spirits — like those on your world and similar ones — who misuse their freedom and influence others toward harm. Those who present God as cruel, vengeful, or bloodthirsty are closer to this idea of “demon” than they know.

The word “demon” originally meant simply a non-physical intelligence, whether good or bad. Over time it has come to mean only malevolent beings.

But Spiritist understanding affirms:

* God did not create souls destined to evil.
* No spirit is eternally locked into wickedness.
* “Demons” are better understood as highly imperfect spirits whose present state is temporary.

As for “Satan,” it is an image — a symbolic personification of evil, not an actual rival to God. Just as older cultures represented Time as an old man with a scythe, people have given form to good and evil to help the imagination grasp invisible realities.

In truth, there are only spirits at different stages of growth.
Some are luminous, some are tangled in darkness.

All are invited, in time, to awaken, to be healed, and to return to the Source from which they first came.
