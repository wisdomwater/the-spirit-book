## CHAPTER V – Why Many Lives Make Sense

### 1. Is Reincarnation Really New?

Some people say, “Reincarnation isn’t new. This is just borrowed from Pythagoras.”

And that’s partly true: the idea of souls returning has been around for a very long time. Pythagoras learned it from older traditions in India and Egypt. Long before Spiritism, people were already talking about souls living more than one life.

But that’s exactly the point:

* An idea doesn’t survive across ages, continents, and cultures if it has *no* truth in it at all.
* The persistence of this intuition suggests it taps into something deep in the human spirit.

The ancient version of the teaching, however, often came wrapped in superstition, especially in the form of *metempsychosis* — the idea that a human soul might be reborn as an animal, and vice versa.

Spiritism clearly rejects that:

> Human spirits do not go backward into animal forms, and animals do not become human by reincarnating.

The modern Spiritist understanding keeps the core insight — that we grow through many lives — and removes the parts that conflict with spiritual progress and divine wisdom.

### 2. Put the Spirits Aside for a Moment…

For a moment, imagine you’ve never heard a single message from a spirit. No medium. No communications. Just your own reason and questions.

Now put two ideas side by side:

1. **One single lifetime** only
2. **Many lifetimes** (reincarnation)

Let’s pretend both are equally possible. Now ask: *Which one better fits God’s justice, human experience, and our deepest hopes?*

Some people reject reincarnation simply because they don’t *like* the idea:

* “One life is already too much; I don’t want to come back.”
* “I’d be furious if I had to repeat this all over again!”

But our preferences don’t set the structure of reality. If reincarnation is part of God’s design, we go through it whether it pleases us or not — just like a child who doesn’t want to go to school, or a patient who doesn’t want another day of treatment.

The question isn’t: *“Do I like this?”* The question is: *“Is this wise, just, and coherent with what I know of God and life?”*

### 3. Is Reincarnation a Punishment or a Gift?

Those who fear reincarnation often imagine:

* Endless misery
* Being forced back into suffering
* No way out

But in the Spiritist view, reincarnation is actually a mercy:

* Each new life is shaped by the choices we make now.
* The more we grow in this life, the better and freer our future lives become.
* Once we reach a certain level of inner purity, we *don’t* fall back into the same deep mud again.

Think of this metaphor:

> You’re living a hard, limited life. Someone says to you:
> “You can improve your future. All you have to do is redo, with more love and wisdom, what you once did badly.”
>
> Would you refuse that chance?

Even from a purely human standpoint:

* Would you work a single exhausting day if it guaranteed you a lifetime of abundance and security? Almost everyone would say yes.
* Compared with eternity, one earthly life isn’t even a full day. It’s a breath.

Reincarnation doesn’t say, *“You must suffer forever.”* It says, *“You may work, heal, and grow as long as needed, and nothing is wasted.”*

### 4. One Life Only: Problems We Can’t Solve

Now let’s look at what happens if we assume there is only one single life:

If there is only one incarnation, then either:

* The soul is created at birth, or
* It existed before the body (preexistence)

If the soul existed before the body, then:

* What was it doing before?
* Was it conscious? Advancing? Waiting?
* If it was conscious, that already sounds like some kind of “life.”

If, instead, the soul is created at birth with no past, then we hit a series of questions we cannot answer:

1. Why do children — raised in the same family, with the same education — show such different aptitudes from the beginning?
2. Why are some children clearly gifted — musical, mathematical, intuitive — while others are not, with *no* visible external cause?
3. Why do some children show early virtue (kindness, generosity, nobility), while others show early cruelty, deceit, or meanness — long before they can be blamed on “bad influences”?
4. Why do some people seem to be spiritually and intellectually ahead of their entire environment, as though they were older inside than their age or culture would suggest?
5. Why have some peoples and cultures advanced far in science, ethics, and art, while others remain at a much earlier stage of development, even when they share the same humanity?

If souls are created *equal* at birth, with no past, then:

* These inequalities seem like pure favoritism or cruel chance.
* God appears to create some souls better equipped and others handicapped from the start.

If souls are created *unequal*, that is even harder: Then God would be deliberately creating some spirits advanced and others backward — which contradicts divine justice and love.

Reincarnation, on the other hand, offers a simple, coherent explanation:

> Each soul is born carrying the inner harvest of what it has learned and chosen in previous lives.

Some are “older”, not in age, but in experience. Just as in a room with people from 1 to 80 years old, we see differences that make sense only if we recognize they haven’t all lived the same length of time.

### 5. A Wider View of Humanity

Think of so-called “primitive” and “civilized” peoples. Spiritism doesn’t say:

* “Some are less human,” or
* “There are different species of humanity.”

Instead it says:

> All are equally human, but their spirits are at different stages of their journey.

Everyone is capable of growth. No culture is permanently inferior. No people is eternally chosen or eternally forsaken. God does not love one group more.

Reincarnation lets us hold:

* The equality of all souls in God’s love
* The diversity of their stages in development

at the same time.

### 6. Looking Forward: Justice in the Future

So far, we’ve focused on the present and the past. Now let’s look at the future if there is only one life:

1. If this one life decides everything for eternity, what happens to those who never had real opportunities — spiritually, intellectually, or morally?
2. Will a person who struggled sincerely to grow be on the same level as someone who never had the chance or tools to awaken?
3. How does God judge those who lived in deep ignorance — not by choice, but by circumstance?
4. Millions die every year without ever hearing a single coherent spiritual teaching. Do they simply remain forever in a lower state? On what basis?
5. What about children who die very young, before doing much good or evil at all?

   * If they go straight to eternal happiness, why are *they* exempt from all the struggles others must face?
   * Why are *they* spared the challenges of a full life?

Without reincarnation, these questions press painfully against our idea of a just and loving God. With reincarnation, they soften and unfold:

* Those who die young will live again and have the same opportunities to grow.
* Those trapped in ignorance will eventually incarnate in places and times where light reaches them.
* No one is forever defined by what they *couldn’t* do. We all have as many chances as necessary to learn and to love.

### 7. “But the Church Hasn’t Accepted This…”

Some worry: “If reincarnation isn’t part of official Church doctrine, then surely it must be anti-Christian.”

But we can ask:

* Has the Church ever had to rethink its interpretation of certain passages because of new understanding?
* Would Christianity have survived if it had insisted that the sun literally moves around the earth or that the world was created in six 24-hour days?

In practice, whenever evidence becomes clear, theology eventually adjusts its *interpretation* to better reflect reality and the deeper intention of Scripture.

Some key points:

* Reincarnation, as presented here, is moral, rational, and rooted in God’s justice and mercy.
* Anything truly moral and rational cannot be fundamentally opposed to a faith that proclaims God as goodness and reason.
* There are scriptural hints that align well with the idea of multiple lives.

For example:

> Jesus says of John the Baptist that he is Elijah “who was to come” and also that Elijah “has already come, and they did not recognize him” (Matthew 17).
>
> Taken seriously, this sounds very much like the same spirit, Elijah, living again on earth as John.

When Jesus speaks of being “born again” of water and spirit (John 3), at the very least he points to a reality of rebirth that is deeper than a one-time ritual. Spiritism reads this as fully compatible with the idea of spiritual progress across multiple lives.

### 8. Why This Matters

In the end:

> We did not accept reincarnation *because* the spirits said it.
> We accepted it because it is the only view that
>
> * makes deep moral sense,
> * reconciles the inequalities of life with divine justice, and
> * is confirmed by observed spiritual phenomena.

If evidence had shown it to be absurd or unjust, it would have been rejected — even if spirits had said it. Not everything that comes from the invisible world is true; discernment is always needed.

But reincarnation shows itself to be:

* **Logical** – it explains what other theories cannot
* **Consoling** – it gives hope to those who have failed, lost time, or suffered deeply
* **Just** – it allows every soul, eventually, to reach the fullness of happiness

Reincarnation is not a threat; it is a life-preserver. It is the rope God throws into the stormy sea of human experience, saying, *“You are not lost. You can try again. Nothing good is wasted. I will walk with you until you are fully home.”*
