## Chapter 11 — The Three Kingdoms

### Minerals and Plants

**585. How should we think about the divisions of nature?
Are there three kingdoms? Two classes? Four realms?**

All of these viewpoints can be useful, depending on what we wish to understand.

From a material perspective, nature can be divided into what is purely inert
and what is alive.

From a moral or spiritual perspective, we can perceive four ascending degrees:

1. matter,
2. plant life,
3. animal life,
4. and human life.

These four levels blend at their edges, yet each carries a distinct character:

* Minerals are inert matter shaped by mechanical forces.
* Plants have vitality, though no conscious perception.
* Animals possess vitality and a limited, instinctive intelligence.
* Humans carry all of these qualities and go further:
  with unlimited intelligence, awareness of destiny, moral perception,
  and the capacity to seek and know God.

**586. Do plants have awareness of their existence?**

No. They do not think.
They live, but without the consciousness that belongs to spirit.

**587. Do plants feel sensations? Do they suffer when injured?**

Plants receive physical reactions—pressure, heat, and other influences—
but they do not perceive.
They do not feel pain in the way conscious beings do.

**588. Is the attraction between plants voluntary?**

No.
It is simply the interaction of matter with matter—
a natural force, not a choice.

**589. Some plants move as if they feel or decide.
Does this mean they think, or that they are a bridge between plants and animals?**

All of nature flows in gentle transitions,
yet the mimosa or the venus flytrap does not think or choose.
Their movements are no more conscious than the automatic closing
of certain organs in the human body.

Nature is filled with responsive mechanisms that mimic intention,
but they arise without awareness.

**590. Do plants have an instinct for self-preservation?**

Only in the most mechanical sense.
They respond to what suits their structure,
much like chemicals combine through affinity—
but without thought or intention.

**591. On highly evolved worlds, are plants more advanced?**

They are more beautiful, refined, and harmonious—
yet still true to their nature.
Just as animals remain animals,
and human beings remain human,
each kingdom retains its essence even as it rises.

### Animals and Human Beings

**592. If some animals seem more intelligent than certain humans,
how can we draw a boundary between them?**

Humans and animals share many physical traits,
and humans can fall very low—or rise very high.

Human beings resemble animals in the body,
but not in destiny.
The human spirit alone carries the freedom
to discern God and contemplate eternity.

**593. Do animals act only through instinct?**

Mostly, yes—yet some display actions that go beyond instinct.
Their intelligence is limited,
but it does allow for choice within narrow bounds.

Animals act with a small, focused sense of awareness
directed toward their survival and needs.
But they do not create, improve, or innovate.
Their skills remain constant across generations.

**594. Do animals have language?**

Not human language—
but yes, they communicate.

Their signals and expressions serve their needs
just as human gestures can express meaning without words.
Even creatures without voices—fish, insects, certain mammals—
have ways of warning, guiding, and gathering.

Their communication is instinctive and limited.
Human language, by contrast, is expandable and expressive
of the vast landscape of human thought.

**595. Do animals have free will?**

Only in a limited sense.
They are not machines,
but their choices are bound to survival
and do not rise to the moral freedom of humans.

**596. Why can some birds imitate human voices better than apes?**

Because of the structure of their vocal organs
combined with their instinct to mimic.

Apes mimic gestures;
certain birds mimic sound.

**597. If animals have intelligence,
does that mean they possess a principle independent of matter?**

They do have an animating principle—
a soul in a very limited sense—
but one far less evolved than the human soul.

The distance between them
is as great as the distance between humans and God.

**598. Does the animal soul retain individuality after death?**

Its individuality persists,
but without self-awareness.
Its intelligence becomes dormant.

**599. Can an animal soul choose its next body?**

No.
It does not possess the free will necessary for such choice.

**600. Do animal souls exist in an errant state after death like humans?**

They exist without a body,
but not with the freedom and awareness of errant human spirits.

They are quickly reassigned to new forms
by spirits charged with that work.

**601. Do animals progress like humans?**

Yes—by necessity, not by moral choice.

On more advanced worlds,
animals are likewise more advanced
and serve humans with greater intelligence and harmony.

**602. Do animals progress by free will?**

No.
Their growth is guided by the natural order,
not by conscious striving—
and therefore they do not experience moral expiation.

**603. Do animals on higher worlds know God?**

No.
As humanity looks to God,
animals look to humans.

**604. Doesn’t permanent inferiority for animals contradict
the unity and harmony of divine creation?**

No.
The links among all beings are subtler than we can yet perceive.
Nothing in God’s creation is without purpose or dignity.
All grows and evolves according to its nature.

Human intelligence bears moral responsibility;
animal intelligence does not.

**605. Do humans have two souls—an animal soul and a spiritual soul?**

No.
Humans have one soul,
but two natures:

* a spiritual nature, which thinks, discerns, and aspires toward God,
* and a bodily nature, with instincts inherited from life in the flesh.

Passions arise from both sources:
some from the body’s impulses,
others from the impurities of the spirit.

As the spirit purifies,
it rises above the heavier pull of animal instinct.

**606. Where do animals receive their intelligent principle?
From the same source as humans?**

Yes.
Both draw from the universal intelligent element—
but in humans, it is developed to a higher and moral purpose.

**607. Where does the human soul begin its early development?**

In earlier forms of existence
before entering the human state.

The intelligent principle grows,
individualizes,
and prepares for conscious life—
much like a seed germinates before becoming a tree.

When it becomes a spirit,
the era of humanity begins:
the awareness of destiny,
of moral responsibility,
and of good and evil.

There is nothing degrading in this origin—
the greatest geniuses were once embryos.
Growth is the law of God’s universe.

* *Does this human period begin on Earth?

Usually not. Often it begins on worlds less evolved than ours, though exceptions exist.

**608. After death, does the spirit remember its pre-human phases?**

No.
Those were not yet spiritual life.
Even early human lives fade from memory,
just as we forget our earliest childhood.

**609. Does a spirit retain traces of its pre-human state?**

Only faint ones,
and only for a time.

As free will develops,
the spirit leaves these primitive impressions behind.

**610. Spirits say humans are beings apart.
Is this incorrect?**

It is true—but incomplete without deeper context.

Humans are distinct: they are the ones God has chosen to carry divine consciousness
and the ability to know God.

### Metempsychosis

**611. If all living beings share the same origin in the intelligent principle,
doesn’t that support metempsychosis?**

No.A seed and a tree share an origin
but are not the same in nature once developed.

Once the intelligent principle becomes a spirit and enters the human stage,
it no longer relates to its primitive forms. Humans are not reincarnated animals.

The body holds instincts inherited from matter, but the soul is uniquely human.

**612. Could a human spirit incarnate as an animal?**

No. This would be regression—
and the soul does not flow backward.

**613. If metempsychosis is wrong,
why has it appeared in so many cultures?**

Because beneath the misunderstanding
is an intuitive sense of the soul’s many lives
and its journey upward.

The error lies in imagining literal passage
from animal bodies into human bodies and back again.

The truth is transformation, not regression—
progress through many lives
within the dignity of the human species.

### Summary

The origin of spirit and its earliest stages
belong to the mysteries of God.
Even spirits do not know everything.

Some believe the human spirit is prepared
through earlier forms of life;
others believe it has always belonged to humanity.
The important truth is this:

* the spirit survives,
* it grows,
* it becomes happy or unhappy by the use of its freedom,
* and it advances through the moral law that governs all beings.

As for the deeper mysteries of our connection to animals,
these belong to God’s wisdom—
and their understanding is not necessary
for our present spiritual advancement.
