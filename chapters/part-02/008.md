## Chapter VIII — The Emancipation of the Soul

### Sleep and Dreams

**400. Does an incarnate spirit willingly remain in its bodily form?**

Not really. It is like asking whether a prisoner delights in being locked behind bars. The spirit, wrapped in dense matter, naturally longs for freedom, and the heavier the body feels, the stronger that longing becomes.

**401. During sleep, does the soul rest as the body does?**

No. The spirit never ceases activity. When the body sleeps, the bonds that tie it to the soul loosen. Since the body does not require the soul’s full attention in sleep, the spirit slips outward—traveling, learning, and entering more direct communion with other spirits.

**402. How can we confirm that the spirit is free during sleep?**

Through dreams. When the body rests, the soul awakens to a wider life. It recalls fragments of the past and occasionally glimpses the future. It moves with greater ease and communicates with spirits both near and distant.

You often say, “I had such a strange dream—surely it means nothing.” Yet many dreams are faint memories of places your spirit has visited, things you have known, or scenes belonging to another lifetime or world.

Humans think themselves wise, yet remain puzzled by the simplest aspects of life. Children ask, “What happens when we sleep?” and adults rarely have an answer.

Sleep partly frees the soul. In those hours, you briefly taste the state that will be yours permanently after death. Spirits who detach easily after dying often had luminous dreams during earthly life. While sleeping, they visited more advanced spirits, learned from them, and even collaborated on work they later complete after death.

There is no need to fear death—you rehearse it every night.

For less-evolved spirits, sleep may lead them to lower realms, to old pleasures or old attachments, or to ideas even more harmful than the ones they cherish on earth. Affinities formed during these nightly wanderings explain why some people feel drawn to certain individuals and repelled by others without knowing why.

During sleep, every soul touches the spirit world. This is why higher spirits consent to incarnate among you—they are strengthened each night at the fountain of goodness.

Dreams are simply the memories your spirit brings back. But you often retain only fragments, because your soul is still developing and cannot hold the full picture. This is why dreams often feel confused or illogical, and why troubling or absurd dreams visit both sages and simple people. Unfriendly spirits may sometimes take advantage of your vulnerability in dreams.

A more elevated kind of dreaming also exists—the dream of prophets and seers—when the soul becomes entirely free and remembers its life in the spirit realm. Learn to distinguish these gentle unveilings from ordinary dreams, so that confusion does not cloud your faith.

Dreams arise from the soul’s temporary emancipation. The spirit sees things far away, or never seen before, or belonging to other worlds. These visions mix with memories of the present life, creating strange mosaics that seem disconnected. Much of the dream’s incoherence comes from gaps in memory—like reading a story with many missing lines.

**403. Why don’t we always remember our dreams?**

Because only the body is resting. The soul is still in motion. The impressions the spirit receives during sleep do not come through the bodily senses, and the dense body struggles to retain what did not pass through its own organs. Much slips away upon waking.

**404. What should we think about the various meanings people assign to dreams?**

Dreams are not omens in the fortune-telling sense. It is childish to believe that one random symbol always predicts something fixed.

Dreams are true in another way: they show the spirit real images, but often unrelated to waking life. Some dreams recall the past; others offer a glimpse of the future if God allows it. Sometimes they reveal what is happening to someone far away, when their spirit comes to seek you.

If the event later proves real, it is clear that imagination alone was not at work.

**405. Sometimes dreams feel like presentiments of things that never happen. Where do these come from?**

They may be true for the spirit, though not for the body. The soul sees what it desires or fears because it goes searching for it. While the body sleeps, the soul is still influenced by earthly concerns, and imagination can color its visions.

When you are preoccupied with something, you attach that idea to everything you see.

**406. When we dream of people doing things they would never do, is it pure imagination?**

“How do you know they would never think of such things?” their spirits may visit yours, and your spirits converse without you being aware of their true thoughts. At times, your dreams insert familiar faces into scenes from other lifetimes or inner memories.

**407. Is deep sleep required for the spirit to become free?**

No. Whenever the senses quiet, the spirit loosens its bonds. Even during a nap, or a moment of drowsiness, your soul wanders.

**408. Sometimes we hear clear words within us as we drift toward sleep—words unrelated to our thoughts. Where do they come from?**

These may be the faint echo of a spirit trying to communicate with you. Whole sentences may come through when the senses grow quiet.

**409. When our eyes are closed and yet we see vivid images or landscapes, is it imagination?**

Your spirit is beginning to slip free. If sleep were deeper, these visions would simply be dreams.

**410. During sleep or a nap, we sometimes receive beautiful, wise ideas that vanish upon waking. Where do they come from?**

They arise when the soul is freer and endowed for a moment with clearer faculties. They may also be counsel from friendly spirits.

> *What use are such thoughts if we forget them?*

Even when the body forgets, the spirit remembers. At the right moment, that forgotten insight returns as intuition or sudden inspiration.

**411. When the spirit is free during sleep, does it know the time of its death?**

Often it senses it. Sometimes it knows it clearly, and this awareness lingers as a waking intuition. This is why some people foresee their own passing with surprising precision.

**412. Can the spirit’s activity during sleep fatigue the body?**

Yes. The spirit is still tied to the body, and its movement affects the physical form, like a balloon tugging on its tether. If the spirit is very active, the body may wake tired.

### Visits Between the Spirits of Living Persons

**413. Does the soul’s freedom during sleep mean we live two lives at once—one outward and one hidden?**

Not two lives, but two phases of the same life. When the spirit is freed, the bodily life quiets; when the body wakes, the soul’s hidden life retreats again. But they are not two separate existences.

**414. Can two people who know each other meet during sleep?**

Yes, and many who think they do not know each other in waking life meet in spirit at night. You may have unseen friends in distant countries. These encounters are far more common than you imagine.

**415. What good are these visits if we do not remember them?**

Their influence remains. Upon waking, an intuition, an idea, or a feeling often remains—quiet remnants of these nocturnal meetings.

**416. Can a person choose whom they wish to visit in spirit before falling asleep?**

The desire may be present, but the spirit does not always follow the wishes of the waking mind. When free, the soul attends to what truly matters to its deeper nature.

Still, if the reason is noble or needed, the spirit may go where intended. But a mere waking wish does not compel the soul’s nocturnal path.

**417. Can groups of spirits meet during sleep?**

Yes. Old friends—whether from this life or previous ones—frequently gather together joyfully during sleep. These reunions are one reason waking life carries sudden sympathies or subtle understandings among certain people.

**418. If someone believes a friend has died but the friend is actually alive, can their spirits meet during sleep and give the first person a sense of the truth?**

Yes. As a spirit, one can see the living friend and sense her true condition. If the mistaken belief was not meant as a trial, the person may wake with the intuition that the friend is still alive.

### The Concealed Transmission of Thought

**419. Why do the same ideas or discoveries arise simultaneously in many places?**

Because spirits communicate during sleep. Upon waking, each person believes the idea to be their own, when in truth many contributed to its formation.

When you say an idea is “in the air,” you speak more literally than you know.

**420. Can spirits communicate with each other while the body is awake?**

Yes. The spirit is not locked inside the body like something sealed in a box. It radiates outward and can communicate, though not as freely as during sleep.

**421. Why do two people sometimes have the same thought at the same moment?**

Their spirits are attuned and communicating silently. They read each other’s thoughts without realizing it.

Spirit-to-spirit communication does not require speech; thoughts flow naturally.

### Lethargy, Catalepsy, Apparent Death

**422. In lethargy or catalepsy, people often see and hear without being able to respond. Do they perceive through the body’s senses?**

No. They see through the spirit. The spirit is awake but cannot express itself because the bodily organs are momentarily suspended.

> *Why can’t the spirit communicate?*

The bodily condition prevents it. This separation proves that humans are more than a body. When the body is powerless, the spirit continues to live and act.

**423. In lethargy, can the spirit separate entirely from the body, giving the appearance of death, and then return?**

The body is not dead. Some vital functions continue in a hidden way. The connection between spirit and body remains until true death, when the final ties break.

When someone returns from apparent death, it is because death had not actually occurred.

**424. Can care given in time strengthen the ties between spirit and body and save a life that otherwise would be lost?**

Yes. This happens frequently. Magnetism—an infusion of vital fluid—can sometimes revive organs on the threshold of failure.

### Somnambulism

**425. Does natural somnambulism relate to dreams? How can it be explained?**

Somnambulism is a deeper state in which the spirit’s independence is greater than in ordinary dreams. Its faculties are freer. The spirit perceives truths and realities that dreams reveal only dimly.

In somnambulism, the spirit is fully itself, while the body is in a cataleptic rest. The spirit can momentarily leave the body and act through it as one might use a tool.

Dreams are imperfect somnambulism. The senses begin to awaken, impressions become mixed, and memories fragment.

**426. Is magnetic somnambulism related to natural somnambulism?**

Yes—they are the same phenomenon, except one is spontaneous and the other induced.

**427. What is the “magnetic fluid”?**

It is a form of vital force—like animalized electricity—a modification of the universal fluid that permeates all things.

**428. What causes the clairvoyance of somnambulists?**

It is the vision of the soul.

**429. How can somnambulists see through solid objects?**

Because nothing is opaque to the spirit. Matter cannot obstruct a soul; spirits pass through it freely. Somnambulists sometimes think they see through a specific body part only because observers ask them to explain in bodily terms. In truth, the spirit sees without needing any organ.

**430. If clairvoyance is the vision of the spirit, why do somnambulists make mistakes?**

Because imperfect spirits do not see everything clearly. Their limitations, biases, and earthly influences follow them even in the lucid state. God grants clairvoyance for meaningful purposes, not for satisfying idle curiosity.

**431. How do somnambulists speak so precisely about things they have never learned?**

Because the spirit often carries knowledge from previous lives that the brain cannot recall. Somnambulism awakens these deeper layers, though imperfectly.

Some of their insight comes from other spirits who communicate with them. This is why somnambulists sometimes say, “They are telling me to say this.”

**432. How do somnambulists see distant places?**

The same way the soul travels during sleep—by moving beyond the limits of the body.

**433. Does somnambulistic clairvoyance depend on the body or the spirit?**

Both. Some people’s physical constitution allows the spirit to free itself more easily.

**434. Are the faculties of a somnambulist’s spirit the same as those of a spirit after death?**

To a point. But the somnambulist is still tethered to matter, and this limits them.

**435. Can somnambulists see other spirits?**

Yes, often. But if they do not understand what spirits are, they may mistake them for physical people.

**436. Do somnambulists see from where their body is or from where their soul is?**

The soul sees. Location of the body has nothing to do with it.

**437. How can somnambulists feel the heat or cold of distant places their spirit visits?**

Because the spirit remains connected to the body through a subtle bond, like an electric wire transmitting impressions.

**438. Does the use of somnambulistic faculties affect the spirit after death?**

Yes. Like every faculty God gives, how we use it shapes our spiritual state.

### Ecstasy

**439. What is the difference between ecstasy and somnambulism?**

Ecstasy is a higher, more refined form. The soul becomes even more independent from the body.

**440. In ecstasy, does the soul truly visit higher realms?**

Yes. It perceives realms of light and the joy of their inhabitants. This is why ecstatics often long to remain there.

**441. When ecstatics say they want to leave earthly life, do they speak sincerely?**

Often, yes. If they glimpse a future state that is far more peaceful than their earthly life, they may strive to break the bonds that hold them here.

**442. If ecstatics were left entirely alone, could their soul leave the body permanently?**

Yes. Their life might end. This is why one must gently call them back, reminding them that breaking the final thread would not keep them in their state of bliss—it would hasten them onward before they are ready.

**443. Ecstatics often describe visions that reflect earthly beliefs or prejudices. Are these visions real?**

They are real to them, but their expressions are colored by their earthly ideas and language. Thus, they may misinterpret or misdescribe what they see.

**444. How much trust can we place in ecstatics’ revelations?**

We must be cautious. Ecstatics can be mistaken, especially when they attempt to grasp mysteries beyond human reach. Less-evolved spirits may also take advantage of their enthusiasm.

**445. What do somnambulism and ecstasy reveal? Are they glimpses into the future life?**

Better to say that they reveal glimpses of both past and future life. By studying them, humanity can solve many mysteries that reason alone cannot reach.

**446. Can somnambulism and ecstasy be reconciled with materialism?**

Anyone who studies them sincerely, without prejudice, cannot remain a materialist or an atheist.

### Second Sight

**447. Does “second sight” relate to dreaming and somnambulism?**

Yes. It is the spirit seeing with greater freedom, even while the body remains awake. Second sight is the soul’s vision.

**448. Is second sight permanent?**

The underlying faculty is permanent in the spirit, but the ability to use it varies. On more refined worlds, where bodies are lighter, this faculty is nearly constant.

**449. Does second sight appear spontaneously, or can it be summoned by will?**

Usually spontaneous, but focused will can help some people—like certain seers or fortune tellers—enter the lucid state.

**450. Can second sight be developed through practice?**

Yes. Persistent effort thins the veil.

> *Is this ability tied to physical constitution?*

Yes. Some bodies support this faculty more than others.

**451. Why does second sight run in certain families?**

Because physical and energetic tendencies are inherited, and the ability is often strengthened through shared traditions and upbringing.

**452. Can certain circumstances awaken second sight?**

Yes. Illness, danger, strong emotion, or crisis can open the soul’s inner vision temporarily.

Throughout history, oppressed groups and individuals have often shown such heightened sight in moments of peril.

**453. Are people with second sight always aware of it?**

Not always. Many think it is simply a natural part of the way they perceive the world.

**454. Is the intuitive sharpness of some people—a keen ability to judge character—linked to second sight?**

Yes. It is the soul perceiving more directly, without the usual veil of matter.

> *Can this faculty reveal future events?*

Sometimes. Presentiments and premonitions are forms of this sight.

### A Theoretical Summary on Somnambulism, Ecstasy, and Second Sight

**455. Summary**

Natural somnambulism occurs spontaneously, while magnetic somnambulism is intentionally induced. Both are real and well-established, and both reveal that the soul can act independently of the body.

For Spiritism, somnambulism is more than a curious physical phenomenon—it is a window into the soul. Clairvoyance, the ability to see without the bodily eyes, demonstrates that the soul perceives directly.

Somnambulistic sight is not bound to any organ. The spirit sees wherever it goes, because it is the spirit—not the body—that perceives.

These phenomena show that the soul can partially separate from the body without fully breaking the tie of life. This separation can bring fatigue to the body, especially if the spirit is deeply active.

As spirits are imperfect, their clairvoyance is limited and often unreliable when pressed beyond its natural purpose.

In somnambulism, the soul communicates easily with other spirits through the subtle touch of their perispiritual fluids, like messages flowing along a conductive wire. This is why somnambulists are highly sensitive to the emotional atmosphere around them.

They sometimes speak of themselves as if they were speaking of another person, because they are aware of both their spirit and bodily existence at once.

Through successive lives, the spirit accumulates knowledge, which somnambulism may briefly unveil. Somnambulists may draw information from their own past, from present events, or from teachings given by other spirits.

These phenomena offer undeniable evidence of the soul’s existence and independence, and they serve as living lessons in the study of the spirit.

Ecstasy marks an even higher degree of emancipation. The soul glimpses heavenly realms, feels celestial harmonies, and experiences a foretaste of eternal joy. But its revelations may be colored by earthly ideas or influenced by imperfect spirits.

Second sight, a mild form of this same faculty, can occur even while awake, allowing the soul to perceive beyond ordinary senses.

Somnambulism, ecstasy, and second sight are simply variations of the same truth: the soul is more than the body, and at times it steps beyond its physical limits.

These phenomena have existed since ancient times, offering explanations for many events once labeled “supernatural.” They belong to the natural order—expressions of the spirit’s quiet longing for freedom, its vision beyond the visible, and its enduring life beyond the veil of matter.
