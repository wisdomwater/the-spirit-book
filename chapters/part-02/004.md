## CHAPTER IV — The Plurality of Existences

### Reincarnation

**166. If a soul doesn’t reach perfection in one life, how does it continue its purification?**

By entering a new life, a new incarnation, another chance to grow.

> *Does this transformation happen only as a spirit, without any more bodies?*

Inner transformation is always spiritual at its core, but the soul needs the challenges and relationships of bodily life to deepen and prove that transformation. So yes: the soul lives *many* bodily lives.

> *So after leaving one body, the soul takes another — it reincarnates?*

Exactly.

**167. What is the purpose of reincarnation?**

Reincarnation serves two great purposes:

* **To repair and heal** (expiation)
* **To grow and advance** (progressive improvement)

Without multiple chances, how could divine justice and divine love both be true?

**168. Is the number of lives fixed, or do we reincarnate forever?**

Each incarnation is a step forward. Once the soul has shed all its impurities and learned what it needs to learn, it no longer needs to incarnate into dense worlds like ours.

**169. Is the number of incarnations the same for everyone?**

No. Souls who respond quickly to grace and lessons need fewer lives; those who resist learn slowly and require more. But in general, the journey is long for everyone.

**170. What becomes of a spirit after its final incarnation?**

It becomes a blessed spirit — what we might call a **pure spirit**, fully conscious of love, truth, and union with God.

### The Justice of Reincarnation

**171. What is reincarnation based on?**

On two pillars:

* The **justice** of God
* The **revelation** given through spirits and spiritual experience

A loving parent always leaves a path open for a child to turn around. Would God — wiser and more loving than any parent — lock eternity after one short, fragile lifetime?

Reincarnation shows God:

* Not as a harsh judge handing out one final sentence after one attempt
* But as a patient, steadfast guide who offers new chances, new settings, and new lives for growth and repair

Without reincarnation:

* Those born into terribly limiting circumstances would be permanently disadvantaged
* Those who die young would either receive unearned bliss or permanent loss
* There would be no fair way to reconcile all the inequalities of earth with the goodness of God

Reincarnation says:

> You will never be locked out of goodness forever.
> You may stumble, delay, resist —
> but the door is always open, and the path goes on.

For those who know their own imperfections, this is deeply consoling. They do not expect to be equal to the saints immediately, but they trust: *“I can keep growing. I can try again. Nothing good is wasted.”*

### Incarnation on Different Worlds

**172. Are all our incarnations lived on earth?**

No. We can incarnate on many worlds. Life on earth is not our first nor our last, and earth is among the more material, less spiritually evolved schools.

**173. Do we change worlds every time, or can we have multiple lives on the same planet?**

We can absolutely live many lives on the same world.

> *So we may come back to earth more than once?*

Yes.

> *Can we leave earth, live elsewhere, and then come back again later?*

Yes. You may already have done so.

**174. Is it necessary to come back to earth specifically?**

No. If a soul does not progress, it may incarnate on another world of similar or even lower level. The important thing is not the planet but the *lessons* and the *heart*.

**175. Is there any special benefit to coming back here?**

Not in itself, unless the soul comes with a specific mission. But every world offers opportunities to grow in love and wisdom.

> *Wouldn’t it be better just to stay a spirit?*

No. That would stall your growth. We grow by engaging, choosing, loving, and struggling in concrete situations — and that usually means incarnation.

**176. Can spirits come to earth for the first time after having lived on other worlds?**

Yes. There are many souls on earth now who have never incarnated here before.

> *Can we recognize a “first-timer” somehow?*

No in any practical way. And it’s not really important for your own journey.

**177. To reach full perfection, must a spirit live on *all* the worlds in the universe?**

No. There are many worlds at similar levels. A spirit doesn’t need to visit every planet — only enough environments and situations for it to learn what it needs to learn.

> *Then why multiple lives on the same globe?*

Because even on one world you can live many very different kinds of lives: rich/poor, powerful/weak, healthy/sick, privileged/marginalized. Each offers new experiences and new growth.

**178. Can spirits come back to less evolved worlds than the ones they’ve already experienced?**

Yes, for two main reasons:

* **As a mission**: to help others, to serve, to teach, to love in difficult conditions
* **As a consequence of their choices**: if they have wasted opportunities, they may find themselves in worlds that reflect their current inner state

But they do not *regress* as spirits. They are simply in environments that match their level and needs.

> *Who has to repeat the same type of life?*

Those who fail their main lessons or missions. They repeat, not because God is vindictive, but because growth requires practice.

**179. Are the inhabitants of a single world all at the same level?**

No. Just like earth, every world contains a spectrum: some souls are more evolved, others less.

**180. When a spirit passes from one world to another, does it keep its intelligence?**

Yes. Intelligence never disappears, though its expression can be limited or expanded by the kind of body and brain it takes on.

**181. Do the inhabitants of other worlds have bodies like ours?**

They have bodies, but not necessarily like ours. The spirit needs some kind of material envelope to act in a material environment. The density, form, and needs of that body vary with the world and with the spirit’s level of refinement.

**182. Can we truly know what life is like on other worlds?**

Only up to the level we can understand. Spirits reveal things in ways that won’t overwhelm or confuse us. Beyond that, we will learn more directly as we, ourselves, grow.

As spirits become purer:

* Their bodies become lighter, less dense, less needy
* Their perception expands — what we only sense inwardly, they may directly perceive
* Their societies outgrow war, hatred, exploitation, and brutal competition
* Death becomes more like changing rooms than a terror

Lifespans and bodily conditions vary from world to world. The more refined the body and the more peaceful the soul, the less suffering there is and the less quickly the body breaks down.

**183. When a spirit incarnates on a new world, does it always pass through childhood?**

Yes, but childhood is not always as limited and unconscious as it often is on earth.

**184. Can spirits choose the worlds where they will incarnate?**

Sometimes they can request, and if they are ready, their request may be granted.

> *If a spirit doesn’t request, what determines its next world?*

Its level of purification — the inner state of the soul.

**185. Is the state of a given world fixed forever?**

No. Every world evolves. Earth itself is in process and will one day be transformed into something more peaceful and harmonious, when humanity collectively chooses goodness over cruelty.

**186. Are there worlds where spirits incarnate only in very subtle bodies, almost like the perispirit alone?**

Yes. In those realms, the envelope is so ethereal that from our point of view it hardly seems material at all. This is the state of the most purified spirits.

**187. Is the perispirit the same everywhere?**

No. Its refinement changes according to the world and the spirit’s development. When moving between worlds, spirits take on the perispiritual “substance” appropriate to that world almost instantly.

**188. Do pure spirits live on specific worlds, or only in free space?**

They have their own high realms and spheres, but they are not confined the way we are. Their presence and influence can be felt in many places at once.

### Progressive Transmigration

**189. From the moment it is created, does a spirit have full powers and awareness?**

No. Spirits, too, have a kind of infancy. At first they are only dimly conscious, acting more by instinct than clear understanding. Their intelligence unfolds gradually.

**190. What is the soul like in its first incarnation?**

It is like a child trying its first steps — alive, but very simple in awareness, just beginning to engage and learn.

**191. Are “primitive” humans in a kind of spiritual childhood?**

They are in a comparatively early stage, yes, but not empty. They already have passions and drives. Passion shows activity and a sense of self, but not yet wisdom.

Spirits move through phases:

* Spirit infancy
* Youth and growth
* Maturity
* Fullness of wisdom and love

Unlike physical life, there is no senility or decline at the end. The journey has a beginning but not an end.

**192. Can a person, by perfect conduct in this single life, skip all intermediate stages and become a pure spirit at once?**

No. Our idea of “perfection” is still very limited. We cannot skip entire levels of understanding and experience. We can, however, shorten and soften future trials by living as faithfully and lovingly as possible now.

> *Can we at least secure a gentler future life?*

Yes. Every honest effort to grow reduces future difficulty. Only those who neglect growth remain stuck.

**193. Can a person “go backwards” in later lives?**

They can fall in status or circumstance outwardly — from privileged to poor, from powerful to obscure — but as *spirits*, they do not regress. Once a lesson is really learned, it is never truly lost.

**194. Can the soul of a good person inhabit the body of a wicked person in a future life?**

No. A spirit cannot become morally worse than it has become.

> *Can a wicked spirit become a good one?*

Yes. That is the whole point of the journey — transformation. Repentance and renewal are always possible.

**195. Doesn’t the possibility of future improvement encourage some people to stay on the wrong path, thinking, “I’ll fix it later”?**

In theory, yes; in reality, not so much. Those who truly think that way usually don’t believe in anything deeply — not in hell, *nor* in reincarnation. They drift.

Trying to scare people into goodness with eternal punishment often fails; people’s reason rejects it. When they later discover Spiritist truths, the soul deeply regrets having wasted time and opportunities. In the next life, it often carries a stronger determination to grow.

**196. Is earthly life like a sieve through which spirits must pass to be purified?**

That’s a good image. Each life offers:

* Opportunities to avoid evil, to repair harm, to practice love
* Situations that refine both character and understanding

After many lives and many inner shifts, the soul moves toward the fullness for which it was created.

### The Fate of Children after Death

**197. Is the spirit of a young child as advanced as that of an adult?**

Sometimes it is more advanced. The body may be young, but the spirit may have lived many lives and acquired great experience.

> *So a child’s spirit can be more evolved than its parents’ spirits?*

Very often.

**198. If a child dies very young and has done no evil, is it therefore a highly evolved spirit?**

Not necessarily. It has done no evil in this life, but also had little time to do much good. If it is pure, that purity comes from progress made in previous lives, not from the mere fact of dying as a child.

**199. Why does earthly life end so early for many children?**

Several reasons:

* The few years of a short life may be the remainder of a previous life that was interrupted
* Their death may be a part of the parents’ own trials or reparative lessons
* The spirit may need only a brief contact with material life before moving on

> *What happens to a child’s spirit then?*

It returns to the spirit world and will later begin a new existence.

If we had only one life, and eternal destinies were fixed at death, then:

* Half of humanity, dying young, would be exempt from struggle and be given bliss with no effort
* The other half would suffer the full weight of earthly difficulties

This would contradict any idea of true justice. Reincarnation restores balance and fairness: *everyone* has the same long-term possibilities; no one is permanently favored or disfavored.

Childhood is not always pure innocence. We sometimes see in children:

* Cruelty
* Cunning
* Deceit
* Early tendencies toward violence or vice

These do not come from upbringing alone; they often reveal the still-imperfect nature of the spirit, carrying forward tendencies from previous lives — tendencies now to be worked on and healed.

### Gender in Spirits

**200. Are spirits male or female?**

Not in the way we are. Sex belongs to the body, not the soul. Spirits have love, affinity, and deep bonds, but not gendered bodies.

**201. Can a spirit who once incarnated as a man later incarnate as a woman, and vice versa?**

Yes. The same spirit may incarnate in either sex.

**202. Do spirits have a preference about which sex they will incarnate as?**

Not fundamentally. What matters is which experiences and lessons they need. Each sex offers different opportunities and challenges, and spirits must grow in both.

---

### Kinship and Family Ties

**203. Do parents transmit any part of their soul to their children, or only the biological life?**

Only the biological life. The soul is indivisible. A “foolish” parent can have a brilliant child, and vice versa.

**204. If we’ve had many existences, do family ties extend back into previous lives?**

Yes. Reincarnation weaves long networks of relationship. Many of the people in your life now may have been connected to you in former lives in different roles.

**205. Does reincarnation destroy family bonds by pushing them back into previous lives?**

It actually **deepens** and **extends** them.

* Instead of having only one brief set of family ties, souls meet again in many constellations across lifetimes
* The call to brotherhood and sisterhood extends beyond blood and beyond a single generation

Your neighbor, your coworker, or your child may be a spirit who was once much closer to you in another life.

**206. If family spirits don’t literally “descend” from one another, is it still meaningful to honor our ancestors?**

Yes. It is a good thing to feel grateful for a family line that has hosted more evolved spirits. But the true honor you give them is not in boasting of their name — it is in continuing their goodness, their integrity, their compassion.

---

### Physical and Moral Likeness

**207. Parents often pass physical traits to their children. Do they pass moral traits as well?**

Not directly. The body comes from the body, but the spirit does not come from the spirit.

> *Where do moral similarities between parents and children come from then?*

From **affinity**. Similar spirits are drawn to each other, and a spirit may choose (or be led) to incarnate in a family whose tendencies resonate with its own.

**208. Do the parents’ spirits influence their children after birth?**

Yes, profoundly. Parents have the sacred mission of guiding, educating, and helping shape their children’s souls. If they neglect this duty, they bear responsibility for that neglect.

**209. Why do good, virtuous parents sometimes have deeply troubled or wicked children?**

Because such spirits may deliberately seek good parents, hoping that the parents’ example and guidance will help them change. Their presence can also be a trial and an opportunity for the parents’ own growth.

**210. Through prayer and intention, can parents attract a good spirit rather than a troubled one as their child?**

They cannot override the justice and wisdom of God’s choices, but they can help transform the spirit entrusted to them. Even difficult children can be softened and uplifted by loving, wise parenting.

**211. Why do siblings, especially twins, often share similar characters?**

They are often sympathetic spirits — souls drawn to each other by similar tendencies, happy to go through life together again.

**212. In conjoined twins, are there two spirits or one?**

There are two spirits, even though their bodies are partly joined and may seem to act as one.

**213. If twins are often sympathetic spirits, why do some twins strongly dislike each other?**

Because it is not a rule that all twins are harmonious spirits. Sometimes two troubled spirits incarnate together to work out conflict and learn through struggle.

**214. What about stories of children “fighting in the womb”?**

These are poetic images, symbolic ways of describing deep-seated conflict — not literal descriptions.

**215. Where does each culture’s distinctive character come from?**

Spirits also form “families” of likeness. Entire peoples and cultures often gather spirits with similar tendencies and levels of development. That is why cultures have unique flavors and collective habits.

**216. Do individuals keep something of their former moral character in new lives?**

Yes, but transformed over time. As spirits evolve, their character changes. Their social position can also be very different, making them hard to recognize from one life to another, though certain underlying tendencies may still show through until they are fully healed.

**217. Do we carry any physical resemblance from one life to another?**

Not strictly — the body changes. But the spirit subtly shapes its body, especially the face. The eyes, expression, and general “feel” of a person can reflect the inner soul, and sometimes you sense a kind of spiritual familiarity that hints at continuity across lifetimes.

---

### Innate Ideas

**218. Does an incarnate spirit retain anything of the knowledge and perceptions it had in previous lives?**

Yes, as **vague memory** and **inner leaning**. This is what we call innate ideas — intuitions, tendencies, and sensibilities that seem to be there from the start.

**219. Where do extraordinary natural abilities come from — like someone who seems to “just know” languages, music, or math without study?**

These are echoes of previous work. The soul has exercised these abilities before; what looks like “genius from nowhere” is often the fruit of effort in earlier lives.

**220. Can a spirit lose certain abilities in a new life, like artistic taste or talent?**

They can be set aside for a time. Some talents go dormant for a whole life because the soul chooses to focus on other areas. Misuse of a gift can also lead to it being withheld or reduced temporarily. But nothing is truly lost; it can reappear in future incarnations.

**221. Is our instinctive sense of God and life after death a memory from our time as spirits?**

Yes. Even in so-called “primitive” states, humans carry an inner echo of the spiritual world. That echo can become distorted by superstition and fear, but it is there.

> *Is that also why so many cultures contain beliefs similar to the Spiritist teachings?*

Yes. These ideas are as old as humanity because they express something deeply inscribed in the soul. Across time and culture, beneath mythology and symbol, you find the same intuition: **we are more than bodies; life continues; the invisible world is real.**
